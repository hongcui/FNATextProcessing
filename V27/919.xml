  <description>Plants in a low turf, scattered or gregarious, occasionally bulbiform, reddish
        brown distally, brown proximally. Stem very short, 0.2–0.4 mm, hyalodermis absent,
        sclerodermis absent or weakly differentiated, central strand present or absent; axillary
        hairs of 3–6 cells, the proximal 1-2 cells usually with thicker walls. Leaves appressed when
        dry, weakly spreading, tips occasionally reflexed when moist, lanceolate, elliptical or
        ovate, adaxial surface weakly concave to broadly channeled, short, 0.6–1.8 mm; base not
        differentiated, proximal margins not differentiated; distal margins recurved at mid leaf and
        commonly recurved to near apex, entire or rarely serrulate near apex, margins occasionally
        less papillose and somewhat thicker walled than medially; apex broadly acute; costa
        excurrent as an apiculus, mucro or short awn, occasionally only percurrent, adaxial
        outgrowths occasionally present as a pad of enlarged parenchymatous cells, adaxial cells
        quadrate or short-rectangular or elongate, in 2(4–6) rows; transverse section usually round,
        adaxial epidermis present, adaxial stereid band absent, guide cells 2(–4) in 1 layer,
        hydroid strand present, occasionally central, abaxial stereid band present, round to
        semicircular in sectional shape, abaxial epidermis present; proximal cells differentiated
        across leaf or higher medially, rectangular, 2–4:1, walls of proximal cells usually thin;
        distal medial cells quadrate to hexagonal or short-rectangular, occasionally rhomboidal,
        small to somewhat enlarged, 11–15 µm wide, 1–2:1, 1-stratose; papillae usually simple
        (seldom 2-fid), hollow, 1–6 per lumen, occasionally branching and tall, cell-walls thin to
        moderately and evenly thickened, convex on both sides. Specialized asexual reproduction
        absent. Sexual condition monoicous, usually paroicous, occasionally synoicous. Perichaetia
        terminal, interior leaves often somewhat enlarged, otherwise little differentiated. Seta
        very short to elongate (to 4 mm). Capsule stegocarpous or cleistocarpous, theca ovate to
        short elliptical, apiculate when cleistocarpous, 0.5–1.1 mm, annulus absent or of 1–2 rows
        of weakly vesiculose cells, persistent; operculum when differentiated low-conic, peristome
        teeth when present 16, irregular, often rudimentary, ligulate to triangular in shape,
        untwisted. Calyptra conic-cucullate, occasionally mitrate. Spores large, 20–30 µm. KOH
        laminal color reaction red.</description>

  <discussion>Microbryum is similar to Syntrichia in its broad leaves, single stereid band, and
        red reaction of the lamina to KOH, but differs in the short stems, distinctive reduction
        series involving the sporophyte, round to semicircular costal stereid band (reniform in
        Syntrichia), peristomes (when present) of 16 irregular, often rudimentary, truncate
        peristome teeth that are large in comparison with the size of the capsule, and operculum
        (when present) low-conic. Adaxial costal pads of cells are occasionally present (in M.
        vlassovii). Distinguishing features include variation in ornamentation and size of the
        spores, and collections of these monoicous taxa usually include sporophytes.</discussion>
