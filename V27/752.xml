Specialized asexual reproduction by ovate gemmae, sometimes uncommon, occasionally apiculate by a projection, of ca. 8 cells, born on rhizoids in leaf axils.

Though apparently rare (California in Inyo County, Colorado in Boulder and Larimer counties, Nevada in Clark County), its small size and similarity to sterile Gymnostomum make A. handelii easy for collectors to pass over. C. C. Heyn and I. Hernnstadt (2004b) provided additional discussion of this curious species.</discussion><references heading="SELECTED REFERENCE"><reference>Zander, R. H. and W. A. Weber.  2005.
