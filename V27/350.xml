Stems 1–4 cm, central strand present.  Leaves erect and appressed when dry, recurved to squarrose when moist, broadly lanceolate, tapering to an acute apex, 1.5–2.5 × 0.4–0.6 mm, keeled, margins recurved on one or both sides, awns absent to rather long, stout and denticulate, costa reniform, projecting on dorsal side, median layer of stereids present; basal juxtacostal laminal cells short-rectangular to occasionally elongate, straight to slightly sinuose, thin- to thick-walled; basal marginal laminal cells quadrate to short-rectangular, thickened transverse walls; medial laminal cells oblate to rounded-quadrate, straight, thick-walled; distal laminal cells 1-stratose with 2-stratose ridges, margins 2-stratose.  Gemmae in clusters, multicellular, occasionally present in leaf axils.  Sexual condition dioicous.  Seta arcuate, 3–4.5 mm.  Capsule occasionally present, exserted, ovoid, brown, shiny, weakly striate, exothecial cells thin-walled, annulus present, operculum rostrate, peristome teeth orange, fully-developed to irregularly cleft at apex, papillose.

In North America, it occurs along the west coast, from Vancouver Island south to Mexico.  From that region, it has been described frequently as a new species.  It is closely related to G. trichophylla, but is distinguished by somewhat shorter and broader leaves that are straight and appressed when dry and recurved to squarrose when moist, and by a reniform costa.  Furthermore, it is characterized by a grass-green mid leaf areolation with small, rounded, frequently oblate cells with straight walls.</discussion></treatment>
