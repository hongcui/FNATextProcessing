  <discussion>Racomitrium lanuginosum is widely distributed throughout the Nearctic and Greenland, where it reaches the highest possible latitudes, becoming rare and scattered southwards.  It usually occupies habitats of varying moisture regimes, but exhibits a tendency for growing in exposed, dry, and insolated situations.  The often extensive and tumid patches of it found on rocks and soil are mostly hoary when dry.  This is due to the very long hyaline awns that at once separate it from all other species of the broadly conceived Racomitrium.  The shape of the hair-points is unique not only in the Grimmiaceae but among the mosses.  Niphotrichum species often have a similar hoary appearance due to their long, papillose, hair-pointed leaves, but they differ from R. lanuginosum in having non-decurrent awns and tall, stout, conical papillae distributed over the leaf cell lumina, as well as large and often decurrent hyaline alar cells.</discussion>
  <discussion>The laminal papillae of Racomitrium lanuginosum are identical to those of the genus Codriophorus, but species of that genus are usually readily distinguished by their muticous leaves.  The only exception is C. varius, which often has pilose leaves but the awns are non-decurrent, smooth to faintly denticulate, and never papillose.  Moreover, it has long-cylindric capsules, smooth setae, and very long, 1â€“1.8 mm peristome teeth, but in general sporophytes are produced infrequently in R. lanuginosum.</discussion>
