    <description>Plants in loose to dense tufts, yellowish green. Stems to 1(–1.5) cm, simple or
        with few branches. Leaves to 2 mm, erect and ± ap-pressed to the stem, oblong-lanceolate,
        widest at or slightly just proximal to the middle, tapering gradually to a rather blunt
        apex, lamina 1-stratose except on margins; margins subentire, plane to narrowly recurved, ±
        erect near the apex, irregularly 2-stratose in the distal half of the leaf; costa
        percurrent, broad, occupying about 1/3 width of the leaf base, in section with a weakly
        developed stereid band on abaxial side of guide cells; cells of proximal part of lamina
        rectangular, thin to moderately thick-walled, becoming slightly shorter and narrower towards
        the leaf apex. Specialized asexual reproduction by rhizoidal tubers. Sexual condition
        dioicous; perichaetial leaves with a sheathing base, abruptly narrowed to a short subula
        about as long as the base or shorter. Seta yellowish, brown to orange-brown with age, to 2.5
        cm or sometimes longer, erect. Capsule erect and symmetric or slightly curved, brown to
        reddish brown, narrowly ellipsoid to cylindric, 1–2 mm, smooth or indistinctly furrowed when
        dry; operculum obliquely conic-rostrate, blunt, 0.3–0.7 mm; peristome divided by
        perforations into 2 ± adhering divisions, 200–220 µm, finely papillose. Spores 13–16 µm,
        appearing smooth or very finely verrucose, brown.</description>

    <discussion>Rhizoidal tubers, consisting of swollen rhizoidal cells and arising laterally from
        axial rhizoids, are known for Ditrichum lineare only from Asia (T. Matsui et al. 1985;
        Matsui and Z. Iwatsuki 1990). This species is very similar in appearance to D. pusillum but
        is distinguished by the rectangular cells of the sheathing leaf base. The leaf margins of
        North American specimens of D. lineare are entire and plane or rarely only weakly recurved,
        irregularly 2-stratose but not noticeably thickened, and the lamina cells are elongate
        rectangular to linear. The leaf margins in D. pusillum are irregularly thickened, serrulate,
        more strongly recurved, and the lamina cells generally subquadrate to short-rectangular.
        Ditrichum lineare also has a subula shorter than the sheathing base, which is unusual in the
        genus. This macroscopic feature is sometimes used to distinguish it from the closely related
        D. pusillum, which has a subula longer than the sheathing base, typical of many species in
        the genus (R. R. Ireland 1982).</discussion>
