  <discussion>Fissidens exilis, first reported for North America by W. C. Steere (1950), is probably inadvertently introduced from Europe.  It can be distinguished from all other tiny Fissidens in the flora area by the 2–3 rows of irregularly elongate intralaminal cells in the vaginant laminae.  Plants of this species would be easily passed over were it not for the persistent protonemata that often form dark green velvetlike carpets over the substrate and the numerous sporophytes that are produced.  The gemmiform perigonia are often seen scattered over the protonemata.  B. H. Allen et al. (2004) have reviewed and mapped the distribution of F. exilis in North America.</discussion>
