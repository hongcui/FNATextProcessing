  <discussion>The most widely distributed species of the genus, Pogonatum urnigerum is notably absent from Middle America and south-temperate South America.  In Nunavut, it is known from Baffin, Ellesmere, and Melville islands.  The plants are usually more robust than are those of P. dentatum, often repeatedly branched, and the crowding of the leaves at the tips of the branches produces a distinctive tiered effect.  The marginal cells of the lamellae are rounded in section, and the lumen is pentagonal, resembling the gable end of a house.  Fruiting plants of the two species can be easily distinguished also by the peristome, which in P. dentatum is deeply divided almost to the base.  Polytrichastrum alpinum also branches repeatedly, but the plants are generally larger and absent the bluish glaucous appearance characteristic of P. urnigerum in the field.</discussion>
