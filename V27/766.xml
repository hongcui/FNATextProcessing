Leaves firm when wet, long-ovate to ligulate, 0.5–1.8(–2) mm, base often elliptic, widened not strongly sheathing, margins plane or weakly recurved to mid leaf, apex broadly acute to rounded, apiculate or occasionally muticous; costa percurrent or ending 1–4 cells before the apex, abaxial costal surface doubly prorate (rough by projections at each end of superficial cells), often also with simple or 2-fid papillae, hydroids absent; distal laminal cells firm-walled, quadrate, 7–10 µm wide, 1:1, papillose.  Specialized asexual reproduction by gemmae borne on stalks in leaf axils.  Perichaetial leaves obtuse to broadly acute, strongly sheathing and convolute.  Seta 1–1.8 cm.  Theca 0.8–1.2 mm.
