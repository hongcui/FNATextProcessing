  <discussion>Dicranum fulvum has dull, blackish green plants, especially evident from the leaves on the basal part of the stems, leaves crisped when dry, broad costae that cover 1/4–1/3 the width of the leaves at base, laminae that are mostly 2-stratose in the distal half of the leaf, and erect, cylindrical capsules that are slightly furrowed when dry.  It is sometimes confused with D. fuscescens but that species has keeled leaves in the distal half, with 2-stratose regions restricted to the margins, and horizontal capsules, whereas D. fulvum has subtubulose leaves, with almost entirely 2-stratose laminae above, and erect capsules.  When D. fulvum has some of its leaf apices broken off, which is not uncommon, it can be confused with D. viride, which has the majority of its leaf tips absent.  The usual occurrence on rock of plants of D. fulvum as opposed to the usual occurrence on bases of tree trunks of D. viride often gives some clue to their identity.  Morphologically, the proximal leaf cells of the two differ: D. fulvum has shorter cells, averaging 24–33 µm, compared to the longer cells of D. viride, averaging 33–42 µm.</discussion>
