  <discussion>Members of subgenus Gasterogrimmia are recognized by their commonly occurring immersed, ventricose capsules on arcuate to sigmoid setae that are eccentrically attached.  Additionally, all these species have three to four large stomata at the very base of the capsule.  The entire basal region of the leaf is typically hyaline.  Most members of the subgenus are restricted to calcareous habitats.  The genus Jaffueliobryum is the only other group in the Grimmiaceae to be so strongly tied to calcareous substrates.</discussion>
