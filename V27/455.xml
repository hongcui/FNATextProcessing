The species in the flora are olive green to brownish, stems ca. 0.6–2 mm; leaves 0.5–2.5 mm, erect, in ± two apparent rows, lanceolate-subulate, obtuse, leaf margins nearly entire, costa filling the subula; and the columella is not developed.  They grow sympatrically on Mt..</discussion><key><key_statement><statement_id>1.</statement_id><statement>Peristome absent; distal laminal cells mostly isodiametric</statement><determination>1.
