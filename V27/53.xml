  <discussion>Sporophytes of Sphagnum mississippiense are unknown.  The combination of broad branch leaves and obtuse stem leaves will distinguish it from S. cuspidatum and S. viride.  The much commoner and more wide-ranging S. trinitense, although also having serrulate branch leaves, has much narrower branch leaves that are more elongate at the branch tips, becoming quite lanceolate as compared with the ovate-lanceolate branch leaves that S. mississippiense exhibits at its branch tips.</discussion>
