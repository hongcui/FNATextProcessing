    <description>Plants reddish brown to black. Leaves erect-spreading to squarrose, straight,
        panduriform, widest distally, apex symmetric; costa absent; leaf margins denticulate along
        leaf base; basal laminal cells rectangular to long-rectangular, marginal cells similar,
        walls pitted, nodose; medial laminal cells rounded-quadrate to ovate, 1-stratose entirely or
        sometimes 2-stratose distally, lumens rounded; laminal papillae rare, low. Sexual condition
        cladautoicous; perichaetial leaves differentiated, convolute-sheathing. Spores 18–28
        µm.</description>

    <discussion>The spores of Andreaea alpina are of two types, the brown spores generally smaller
        than the green, and apparently abortive. This comparatively robust species is easily
        identified by the panduriform leaves with basal marginal denticulations.</discussion>
