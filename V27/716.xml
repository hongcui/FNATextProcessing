Leaves flat but narrowly keeled along costa, long-ligulate, distal margins plane, entire (or tattered by fragmentation), not bordered; apex narrowly rounded, blunt, keeled; basal cells dif-ferentiated across leaf base, not running up margins, not distinctly enlarged submarginally; distal laminal cells with a massive multiplex papillae over each lumen; mucro short-conic, of ca. 3 cells.

The deep, narrow groove down the adaxial surface of the leaf is reminiscent of that of species of Barbula or Anoectangium.  The massive, caplike papillae are similar to those of Tuerckheimia, but the long-ligulate leaf shape of T. portoricense is diagnostic.  The leaf lamina fragments easily in patches, and doubtless figures in asexual reproduction.  The distribution was recently summarized by P. M. Eckel (2003).</discussion></treatment>
