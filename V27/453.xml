    <discussion>Blindia is a small genus of acrocarpous, haplolepideous mosses, characteristically
        found on moist acidic rock substrates. Its peristome is defined by having the outer layer
        thicker than the inner and these are fused to form a single row of 16 papillose or smooth
        teeth. The significant gametophytic features are well-developed alar cells, smooth distal
        leaf cells, and subulate leaves, along with rheophytic or hygrophytic habitats.</discussion>
