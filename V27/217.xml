Leaf apex acute to slightly acuminate; costa percurrent or subpercurrent; sheath clear in the distal leaves, clear or dark reddish black in the proximal leaves; limb green, non-pellucid; limb-sheath transition gradual; limb margins dentate in distal 1/3–1/2, crenulate or slightly toothed proximally, limb lamina cells (8–)11–18(–22) × (9–)10–19 µm, mammillose and with 2–4 papillae on the adaxial surface, with 2–4 papillae and generally also mammillose on the abaxial surface; cells of the sheath lamina with (0–)1–8(–10) large round, often verrucose papillae over the abaxial surface of the lumens; cells at leaf insertion abruptly differentiated into 1 to a few rows of fragile, hyaline cells; limb costa with the abaxial cells 1- or pluripapillose, and the adaxial cells mammillose and pluripapillose.  Sexual condition dioicous; perichaetial leaves longer and more evenly tapering to the apex than stem leaves, with the sheath poorly developed; perigonial leaves shorter than stem leaves, consisting mostly of the sheaths, abruptly apiculate.  Calyptra without longitudinal split, not persistent on seta.  Capsule  non-plicate (only immature ones known); exothecial cells with very sinuose walls; stomata on the neck; endostome cilia with numerous blunt appendiculations on the interior surfaces.</description><phenology>Only one sporulating specimen is known (from Alaska), but the capsules are immature.</phenology><habitat>  Wet or moist, predominantly calcareous sites, often near small streams, on seepage slopes, near snowmelt areas, or in depressions in open tundra; frequently intermixed with other mosses, including other species of Timmia;</habitat><elevation> low to moderate elevations (0–1500 m);</elevation><global_distribution> Greenland</global_distribution><ca_distribution> Alta.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Nfld. and Labr.

It is an Arctic species, rare south of 65° N.  Timmia sibirica has somewhat larger leaf cells than T. norvegica (and the largest cells of any Timmia taxon), and it has deciduous leaves that can aid in vegetative dispersal.</discussion></treatment>
