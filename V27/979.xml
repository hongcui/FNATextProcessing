  <discussion>Calymperes pallidum is known in the flora area only from one collection from Collier County, southern Florida.  The species is very widespread but almost always rare in tropical regions around the world.  Its most distinctive feature is the absence of well-defined stereid cells in the costa in contrast to our other species of Calymperes, which uniformly show two distinct bands of stereids in the costa.  Calymperes erosum is similar to C. pallidum in having teniolae and with distal cells of the cancellinae mammillose, but its costa has strong bands of stereids.  In C. pallidum the apices of the vegetative leaves are often rounded and sometimes almost cucullate.</discussion>
