  <discussion>Archidium tenerrimum is very closely related to A. alternifolium, but is more variable in leaf and stem characters.  It can usually be identified by its spreading perichaetial leaves with wider and more lax median lamina cells and the recurved margin.  Short, dense and branching forms with broader leaves from drier habitats have been named A. ravenelii.  However, these forms seem to intergrade with the taller narrower-leaved forms.  More work is needed on the distinction between these two forms, as they tend to have different distributions as well as ecology.</discussion>
