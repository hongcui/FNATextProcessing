  <discussion>When Ditrichum pallidum is fruiting, the long, yellow setae are distinctive.  The slightly asymmetric capsule and the long, spiculose peristome teeth are similar to those of D. difficile (Duby) Fleischer, a widespread, common species occurring in Mexico, Central and South America as well as elsewhere throughout the world, and D. rhynchostegium.  However, the spores of all three species are easily distinguished.  Spores of D. difficile are finely papillose-verrucose and 12–18(–20) µm; those of D. rhynchostegium are vermicularly papillose-verrucose and 11–15(–18) µm; those of D. pallidum are larger, 15–30 µm, and the exine ornamentation coarsely and openly papillose.</discussion>
  <discussion>Herbarium specimens of Ditrichum pallidum and D. rhynchostegium are sometimes misidentified.  If fruiting, the orange to reddish seta of D. rhynchostegium will immediately distinguish it from D. pallidum with its yellowish seta.  Also, spores of D. rhynchostegium have a distinctly vermicular ornamentation and are smaller.  The operculum of D. pallidum is about half the length of that of D. rhynchostegium.  Vegetatively, plants of D. pallidum have short stems and the leaf base is often ovate to ovate-lanceolate, being gradually narrowed to the subula.  On the other hand, plants of D. rhynchostegium have longer stems and the leaf base is oblong-ovate and abruptly narrowed to the subula.  L. E. Anderson and V. S. Bryan (1958) discussed the similarity of D. currituckii and D. pallidum, but maintained them as distinct species.  H. A. Crum and Anderson (1980–1983) considered D. currituckii to be a variant form of D. pallidum having shorter capsules and peristomes, slightly shorter leaves with the costa somewhat broader at the base.  The morphological and cytological differences were considered by Crum and Anderson (1981) to be insufficient to warrant separation.</discussion>
