  <description>Plants bright green, somewhat glaucous, becoming reddish brown with age.  Stems 1–2.5(–3) cm.  Leaves 2.5–5 mm, lanceolate from a weakly sheathing base, broadly incurved and subtubulose when dry, somewhat spreading but remaining incurved and strongly channeled distally when moist; margins entire to finely and distantly serrulate; costa percurrent or shortly excurrent as a short mucro, the adaxial surface with several low continuous or interrupted abaxial lamellae; abaxial surface of lamina smooth or sporadically with scattered short lamellae near the apex of leaf; adaxial lamellae 8–20, 6–13 cells high, restricted to the costa, crispate-undulate, extending to the middle of the leaf or below, the margins finely and irregularly crenulate with bulging marginal cells, smooth; median cells of lamina 15–20 µm, somewhat smaller towards the margins, rounded subquadrate, thick-walled; marginal teeth distant, minute, unicellular; perichaetial leaves 3–3.5 mm, narrowly lanceolate.  Seta stout, pale brown, 2–4 cm.  Capsule 2–4 mm, cylindric, slightly larger at the base, terete or irregularly angled or ridged; peristome teeth 32, double, somewhat irregular.  Spores 10–15 µm.</description>

  <discussion>An arctic-alpine species widespread in northern latitudes, Oligotrichum hercynicum is a pioneer species, typically forming bright green patches on disturbed soil but, like O. falcatum, also in aquatic habitats.</discussion>
