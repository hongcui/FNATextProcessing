  <discussion>Fissidens appalachensis, restricted to rapidly moving water, is distinguished by its habitat and strong limbidium.  It is most likely to be confused with an expression of F. bryoides that is usually found on wet rocks and stones along the edges of streams, but which differs in its smaller size and weaker limbidium that at times can be partially or completely absent.  Laminal cells in size and shape, vaginant laminae, sexuality, thecae, and peristomes in both taxa are similar.</discussion>
