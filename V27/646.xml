  <author>Rodney D. Seppelt</author>
  <description>Plants slender, elongate, in dense tomentose tufts, yellowish green to dark green.  Stems 1–6 cm, simple or branched; rhizoids from base to middle of stem forming a conspicuous tomentum.  Leaves distichous, linear subula spreading from erect, whitish ovate-lanceolate or oblong sheathing base,  margins plane to slightly incurved, becoming denticulate in subula particularly near the apex; costa excurrent, occupying most of subula, 1/4–1/3 width of leaf at base, subula roughened abaxially; lamina cells of sheathing base linear to oblong-linear, linear-flexuose or rectangular, becoming rectangular distally and quadrate to short-rectangular in subula.  Specialized asexual reproduction unknown.  Sexual condition autoicous, paroicous or synoicous; perigonia axillary, or on short branches proximal to perichaetium; perichaetial leaves not differentiated.  Seta yellow-brown to reddish, elongate, erect.  Capsule erect and symmetric or inclined and asymmetric, exserted, brown, cylindric to ovoid-cylindric, ± wrinkled when dry and empty; annulus of 2–3 rows of large, pale cells, deciduous; operculum conic, straight; peristome single, teeth16, variously split to near the base into 2(–3) minutely papillose filaments, teeth sometimes arranged in 8 groups of 2 teeth.  Calyptra cucullate.  Spores globose to ovoid, finely papillose.</description>
