    <description>Leaves dense, hiding the stem, long-lanceolate to linear-elliptical and commonly
        weakly constricted beyond the short-sheathing base, (1–)1.5–1.8(–2) mm; apex narrowly acute
        to acuminate, occasionally blunt, apiculus narrowly triangular; margins 1-stratose; costa
        regularly excurrent into a short or long, stout mucro of several cells. Specialized asexual
        reproduction absent. Sporophytes absent in range of flora.</description>

    <discussion>Anoectangium stracheyanum was previously treated as a synonym of A. aestivum (R. H.
        Zander 1977), but further study indicates that it is a good match for the Asian A.
        stracheyanum, in the weakly wasp-waisted, narrow leaves with a rather strong, commonly
        multicellular apiculus, and papillose-crenulate or weakly denticulate basal laminal margins.
        The “wasp-waist” referred to by Asian authors is usually just a hint of constriction just
        beyond the short-sheathing leaf base, and many leaves are merely straight-sided. Collections
        from Maine identified as A. peckii are Amphidium mougeotii.</discussion>
