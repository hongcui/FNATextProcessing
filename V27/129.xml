    <description>Specialized asexual structures are usually present. Seta 6–14 mm, erect, straight
        or ± flexuose, superficial cells smooth and spirally twisted the entire length or spirally
        twisted and interspersed with sections of prorulate straight cells. Spores 10–13
        µm.</description>

    <discussion>Using growth studies, R. T. T. Forman (1962) suggested that leaf width and shape are
        influenced by temperature but could be used for species determination in some areas of North
        America, although it appears to be an inconsistent character and should be used with caution
        to determine sterile material. The varieties are distinguished by twisting of the
        superficial cells of the seta in both old, dry, and young, fresh material; the seta itself
        is twisted when dry.</discussion>
