  <discussion>Sphagnum oregonense is currently known only from the type locality. Sporophytes of
        it are unknown. It is associated with other minerotrophic bryophytes such as Meesia
        triquetra, Calliergon cordifolium, and Campylium polygamum. This is a curious species that
        has an obvious close relationship with sect. Cuspidata. When wet it is similar in appearance
        to S. subsecundum but upon drying the sightly undulate and recurved branch leaves give it
        the charactereistic appearance of this section. The branch leave porosity is also more
        similar to that of species in sect. Cuspidata than that found in sect.
        Subsecunda.</discussion>
