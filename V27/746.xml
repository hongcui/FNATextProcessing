  <discussion>Aschisma kansanum is endemic to the United States, being restricted to High Plains grassland (Gary L. Smith 1990) in three counties in west-central Kansas.  Its persistent protonema and habitat are distinctive.  This tiny, very rare species is threatened by over-collecting and grazing.</discussion>
