Leaves 2–6 mm, 0.5–0.6 mm wide at mid-limb; cells of mid-limb lamina 6–10(–11) × 6–9(–10) µm; costa excurrent, smooth on abaxial surface of sheath, smooth or slightly papillose on abaxial surface of the limb, with one–several teeth at back near the apex; base of costa pale and not strongly attached to the stem; stem tips often with loose deciduous clusters of almost linear leaves (ca. 3 × 0.1–0.2 mm).</description><habitat>Calcareous areas, often on shaded limestone cliffs near rivers in Arctic and boreal regions, intermixed with other mosses, including other taxa of Timmia;</habitat><elevation> low to moderate elevations (0–1500 m);</elevation><global_distribution> Greenland</global_distribution><ca_distribution> Nfld. and Labr.
