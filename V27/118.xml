Leaves erect, curved or secund, becoming subulate from an ovate or narrow-rectangular base, widest in proximal half of leaf, apex symmetric; costa present, percurrent and filling the leaf apices, strong, terete, usually reaching the leaf insertion; leaf margins entire or crenulate; basal laminal cells rectangular, walls thin and straight; medial laminal cells usually quadrate, 1-stratose or rarely 2-stratose juxtacostally, lumens rounded-quadrate; laminal papillae rare.  Sexual condition dioicous; perichaetial leaves differentiated, convolute-sheathing.  Spores (10–)13–15(–20) µm.</description><habitat>Rock, alluvium, edges of snow melt areas;</habitat><elevation> low to high elevations;</elevation><global_distribution> Greenland</global_distribution><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Nfld. and Labr.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> N.W.T.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Nunavut</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Que..

Collections commonly lack sporophytes.  Distal laminal cells may be minutely mammillose abaxially, and the leaf margins are thus crenulate.</discussion></treatment>
