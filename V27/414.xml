  <discussion>Codriophorus corrugatus is an east-Asian northwestern North American disjunct boreal-temperate-montane species.  It has only once been collected in North America, in southern Alaska at Dyer’s Lake between Anchorage and Fairbanks.  The species is widely distributed but scattered in temperate eastern Asia.  It is readily distinguished from all other species of the genus by its peculiar leaf acumen and costa.  The snake-like leaf acumen is corrugate or ruffled in the distal part and erose-dentate, cristate, or papillose-crenulate at the apex.  The short costa typically extends to the mid leaf or only a little more distally in some leaves and is often laterally spurred or forked at the apex.  The species may be mistaken for C. fascicularis but in that species the costa extends to 3/4 or further up the leaf and is entire throughout.  Also, the leaf apex in C. fascicularis is entire, whereas in C. corrugatus it is erose-dentate or cristate.  The peristome teeth in C. fascicularis are generally shorter, up to 600 µm, whereas C. corrugatus has longer teeth, 640–760(–950) µm.</discussion>
