  <discussion>Variety inclinata, var. densa, and Tortella rigens are very similar in their
        tubulose and frequently cucullate leaves, and the groove of elongate, smooth cells on the
        adaxial surface of the costa extending throughout the leaf. In North America, var. inclinata
        appears to be restricted to calcareous silt, typically where streams flood (W. C. Steere
        1978). It also inhabits larger sediments, such as the coarse sands along the Great Lakes
        beaches and rivers. It characterizes areas in flood zones lower than those of var. densa,
        which also colonizes sandy soil, but in the crevices of rocks in hilly stations. Tortella
        humilis, which might possibly be confused with these varieties, has a distinct stem central
        strand. The strikingly differentiated perichaetial leaves of var. inclinata occur only in
        association with fertilized archegonia. In var. inclinata the setaceous perichaetial leaves
        may be conspicuous on dry stems where they rise more stiffly above the curled stem leaves—as
        is true of those of T. alpicola, T. fragilis and T. tortuosa. Such perichaetiate plants,
        though uncommon, are easy to confuse with sterile or fertile T. fragilis, but the setaceous
        leaves of that species have propaguloid modifications in the apex whether barren or
        fertile.</discussion>
