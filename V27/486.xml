  <discussion>Fissidens minutulus is often confused with an expression of F. bryoides.  The two have similar habits, and both are found on rocks at edges of streams, although F. minutulus is found principally on limestone, while F. bryoides occurs mostly on acidic rocks.  Moreover, the laminal cells of F. minutulus are small (6–10 µm), strongly bulging, and more or less obscure, unlike the somewhat larger, more or less plane, distinct cells of F. bryoides.  In transverse section the laminal cells of F. minutulus are twice as deep as wide, while those of F. bryoides are more or less as deep as wide.  Stems of F. minutulus are unbranched while those of F. bryoides are branched.</discussion>
