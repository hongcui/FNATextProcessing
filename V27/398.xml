  <description>Plants medium-sized, rarely small or fairly large, mostly slender, in fairly loose
        or dense mats or tufts, light olivaceous, often with a rufous hue in the upper part,
        brownish to blackish brown proximally. Stems (1–)2–5(–9) cm, creeping, ascending to
        suberect, pinnately or sometimes irregularly branched to almost unbranched. Leaves imbricate
        and usually twisted and crispate when dry, erect-spreading to recurved when moist, narrowly
        ovate-lanceolate to triangular, sharply carinate and often distinctly plicate, 1.8–2.5 ×
        0.4–0.7 mm; margins narrowly recurved from the base to 3/4 way up the leaf, plane near the
        apex; muticous or sometimes with a short, to 200 µm, yellowish hyaline, weakly denticulate
        and sparsely papillose awn; costa yellowish, subpercurrent to percurrent, papillose and
        distinctly convex on the abaxial side, situated at the bottom of a fairly deep furrow, 40–60
        µm wide at the base; basal laminal cells elongate 20–50 × 3–5 µm, with strongly incrassate,
        nodulose longitudinal walls, except for 3–5 epapillose cell rows at the insertion forming a
        bright yellow strip; alar cells yellowish hyaline, thin-walled cells in 4–6 rows, forming
        distinct convex auricles; supra-alar cells quadrate to short-rectangular, firm-walled
        forming ± pellucid, often indistinct or absent, marginal border of 10–15 not sinuose cells;
        medial and distal laminal cells subquadrate to short-rectangular, (7–)10–20 × 4–6 µm, with
        low and narrow, sometimes indistinct papillae. Inner perichaetial leaves membranous,
        crenulate-dentate at the apex. Seta brown, 6–10 mm. Capsule brown, cylindric, 1.2–1.5 mm,
        sulcate when dry; peristome teeth lanceolate, 650–850 µm, brown, densely low-papillose,
        2-fid to the base. Spores 9–11 µm.</description>
  <habitat>Rocks, boulders, rocky ground, pockets of soil and humus over rock faces in dry or

  <discussion>Niphotrichum muticum is a circum-North-Pacific species having a discontinuous range
        extending from Honshu in Japan across the Aleutian arc and southern Alaska southwards to the
        Cascade Mountains of Washington, where it was once found with fully mature sporophytes.
        Otherwise, it is consistently sterile. The species is stenotypic. It is readily recognized
        by its leaf margins that are narrowly recurved to mid leaf or three quarters of the leaf
        length and by its leaves consistently muticous or with only a short, yellowish, hyaline,
        almost entire and faintly papillose awn, reaching only to 200 µm. Additionally, the costa is
        strongly convex abaxially and is distinctly papillose on the abaxial side. These features
        will easily separate N. muticum from epilose ecads of N. ericoides.</discussion>
