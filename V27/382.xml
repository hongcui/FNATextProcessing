  <description>Plants fairly large to robust, coarse and rigid, yellowish, olivaceous or brownish in the upper part.  Stems often more than 10 cm long.  Leaves lanceolate; margins recurved on both sides to 1/3–1/2(–3/4) of the leaf length, 1-stratose; long pilose, awns erect-recurved to squarrose, flattened, distantly sharply denticulate at the margins, distinctly decurrent; costa predominantly 3-stratose basally; alar cells undifferentiated; basal marginal border absent or present.  Inner perichaetial leaves strongly modified, yellowish hyaline, chlorophyllose distally, sometimes with a short hyaline hair-point.  Capsule peristome teeth without a basal membrane.</description>

  <discussion>The strongly modified innermost perichaetial bracts with thick-walled, chlorophyllose distal portion and sometimes also with a short hyaline hair-point, as well as not flexuose and distinctly erect-recurved to squarrose hyaline leaf hair-points are diagnostic for sect. Lawtonia.  Apart from Bucklandiella lawtoniae, it contains only B. laeta, a closely related East Asian counterpart of the American species.</discussion>
