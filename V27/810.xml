  <description>Stems to 2.5[–7] cm, sclerodermis present. Leaves ovate, ligulate, elliptic or
        short-lanceolate, (0.3–)1–2(–2.5) mm, entire; leaf base usually not differentiated in shape
        but occasionally widened and ovate; costa ending 1–3 cells before the leaf apex
        (blunt-leaved plants) or percurrent or short-excurrent as a stout mucro, rounded to
        semicircular in section at mid leaf, guide cells 2–4; distal laminal cells usually
        subquadrate, occasionally triangular or transversely elongated, 1:1–2; often 2-stratose
        marginally or in patches medially.</description>

  <discussion>The perichaetial leaves of Molendoa sendtneriana reach 1.7 mm, little more than half
        the length of those of M. hornschuchiana. The phenomenal range of variation in leaf length
        and shape matches that of Dichodontium pellucidum (Dicranaceae). Because M. sendtneriana has
        the appearance of a Didymodon, it is important to examine the collection carefully for the
        distinctive lateral perichaetia (terminal in Didymodon). Both M. sendtneriana and
        Anoectangium aestivum have the distinctive lateral perichaetia, but large plants of the
        former have two stereid bands, and small plants have a costa ending below the apex and also
        often have leaves with 2-stratose portions, features that are absent from the latter in the
        flora area. The most distal leaves of M. sendtneriana are commonly a deep green and
        constrast strongly with the tan proximal portions of the turf. The lateral perichaetia, when
        present, will distinguish this species from Hymenostylium recurvirostrum, which grows
        commonly on the same substrate; when absent, the commonly elongate distal leaf cells in the
        leaf mid portion and the lack of an adaxial costal epidermis of the latter species (in the
        flora area) are helpful distinguishing traits. When sterile, Gymnostomum aeruginosum is
        similar to M. sendtnerianum but has smaller laminal papillae, mostly 3–5 per cell, and
        smaller leaf cells. Often plants of M. sendtneriana are encrusted with a distinctive black
        substance distally. Variation in leaf size and shape is substantial (see R. H. Zander 1977);
        usually the leaf apices of large plants are acute and those of small plants are
        obtuse.</discussion>
