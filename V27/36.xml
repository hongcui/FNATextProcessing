  <description>Plants robust and weak-stemmed; green, golden brown to dark brown; capitulum often flat-topped and with a visible terminal bud; flaccid and plumose in submerged forms to more compact in emergent or stranded forms.  Stems green to brown; superficial cortex of 1–2 layers of moderately thick-walled and poorly differentiated cells.  Stem leaves triangular, large, less than 1.7 mm, mostly appressed to stem, apex weakly apiculate to narrowly obtuse; hyaline cells efibrillose and seldom to often septate at base and sides.  Branches unranked, long and tapering, leaves greatly elongate at distal end.  Branch fascicles with 2 spreading and 2 pendent branches.  Branch stem green, cortex enlarged with conspicuous retort cells.  Branch leaves ovate-lanceolate to lanceolate in aquatic forms, ovate to ovate-lanceolate in emergent forms, greater than 2.5 mm, often falcate-secund, especially in submerged forms, weakly undulate and recurved when dry; margin entire, hyaline cells on convex surface with 0–1 pores per cell, concave surface with round wall thinnings in the cell apices and angles; chlorophyllous cells narrowly triangular in transverse section and well-enclosed on the concave surface.  Sexual condition dioicous.  Sporophytes not seen.</description>

  <discussion>Sporophytes of Sphagnum atlanticum are rare.  The other large North American Atlantic coastal plain species of sect. Cuspidata, S. torreyanum, is typically more yellow, has a more rounded capitulum, and has straight rather than subsecund branch leaves.</discussion>
