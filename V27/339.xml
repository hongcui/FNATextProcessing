  <description>Plants 1–8 cm.  Stem central strand present or absent.  Leaves lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate, keeled, costa projecting on abaxial side, leaf margin recurved on one or two sides; basal marginal cells not hyaline (except G. funalis and G. torquata); laminal cells usually 1-stratose distally (2–4 stratose in G. elatior and G. funalis) except at margin.  Gemmae present or absent.  Seta arcuate to cygneous when moist, centrally attached to capsule.  Capsule cernuous or pendulous, striate to sulcate when dry and empty (smooth in G. attenuata), stomata present at base of capsule (absent in G. anomala).  Calyptra mitrate to cucullate.</description>

  <discussion>Members of subg. Rhabdogrimmia are recognized by their lanceolate, thin, sharply keeled leaves with recurved margins, typically 1-stratose lamina with 1- or 2-stratose margins, and long, arcuate seta with striate to sulcate capsules.  Most members occur on dry acidic rock.</discussion>
