Leaves straight to secund, panduriform, widest in distal half, apex usually symmetric; costa absent; leaf margins entire; basal laminal cells rectangular to long-rectangular, marginal cells rectangular, walls thick, pitted-nodose; medial laminal cells quadrate, 1-stratose, lumens irregularly stellate to rhombic; laminal papillae low or absent.  Sexual condition autoicous; perichaetial leaves differentiated, convolute-sheathing.  Spores 20–35 µm.</description><habitat>Rock or soil in streams;</habitat><elevation> low to moderate elevations;</elevation><global_distribution> Greenland</global_distribution><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Nfld. and Labr.

It is very rare in the flora area and can be distinguished from A. rupestris by the panduriform leaves.</discussion></treatment>
