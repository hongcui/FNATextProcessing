  <description>Plants slender, with the aspect of P. alpinum var. septentrionale. Stems to 2 cm,
        leafless below, leafy above. Leaves channeled and incurved when dry, spreading when moist,
        narrowly triangular, from a broadly elliptic, hyaline-margined sheathing base; marginal
        lamina serrate to almost entire; lamellae 5–6 cells high, crenate in profile, with each cell
        crowned by a papillose knob, the marginal cells in section pyriform. [Seta to 1.5 cm,
        curved. Capsule subspherical; exothecial cells with a distinct thin spot; peristome teeth
        ca. 40, hyaline, now and then compound.]</description>

  <discussion>Polytrichastrum papillatum is known in North America from a single, sterile
        collection from southern Alaska (Valdez), collected by F. J. Hermann, but is possibly more
        widespread and overlooked. The marginal cells of the lamellae are coarsely papillose, and
        resemble those of P. alpinum in section. In profile, however, the lamellae are crenate, the
        marginal cells crowned by a papillose knob. The exothecial cells with a pale but distinct
        thin spot in the outer wall further distinguish this species from P. alpinum.</discussion>
