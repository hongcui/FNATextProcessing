    <description>Plants small, turf-forming or loosely cespitose, green distally, sometimes brown
        proximally. Stems often branching, to 4 mm, hyalodermis absent, sclerodermis weak, central
        strand strong; rhizoids sparse; axillary hairs of up to 5 cells, the basal 1–2 yellow.
        Cauline leaves smaller proximally, distally much larger, rosulate, crowded, incurved to
        spreading, often tubulose and incurved-contorted when dry, widespreading when moist,
        spathulate to oblong-ligulate; base little different in shape; margins incurved, involute or
        sometimes plane, entire or distantly denticulate above; apex rounded-acute to broadly
        rounded-obtuse, usually apiculate; costa short-excurrent, percurrent or ending up to 4 cells
        before the apex, adaxial surface of bulging cells, adaxial epidermis of bulging or
        mammillose cells, abaxial epidermis weakly differentiated, 1–2 stereid bands, guide cells
        2–4 in 1 layer, hydroid strand often present; basal cells not differentiated or distinct in
        a small medial group or across the base, quadrate to short-rectangular, hyaline to
        yellowish; distal laminal cells rounded-hexagonal, walls evenly thickened, adaxially
        bulging-mammillose, abaxially nearly plane; distal laminal papillae often absent, or solid,
        small, simple, 1–2 per lumen abaxially or occasionally on both sides. Specialized asexual
        reproduction absent [gemmae present in leaf axils]. Sexual condition dioicous. Perichaetia
        terminal, leaves ovate-lanceolate to ligulate, shorter than stem leaves. Seta 1–8 mm.
        Capsule red to yellow-brown, ellipsoidal, operculum rostrate, peristome of 16 red,
        spiculose, long-linear teeth, not twisted, basal membrane absent. Calyptra cucullate. Spores
        lightly papillose, 8–10 µm. Laminal KOH color reaction in proximal leaves often
        orange-brown, in distal leaves yellow.</description>

    <discussion>As discussed by R. H. Zander (1993), the circumscription of the genus Hyophila is
        unsatisfactory, being both artificial (e.g., absence of peristome) and polyphyletic. The
        genus Plaubelia is separated from Hyophila mainly by the presence of a peristome. The two
        genera are related by the adaxially bulging, abaxially flat laminal cells, spathulate-oblong
        leaves, poorly differentiated basal cells, similar clavate gemmae (in exotic species) and
        other characters. The single abaxial stereid band of Plaubelia sprengelii was once an
        important basis for the genus, but with the inclusion of var. stomatodonta with its second
        stereid band into the variation of the species (Zander 1983), the generic distinction
        becomes more problematic.</discussion>
