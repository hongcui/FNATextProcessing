  <discussion>Two small species of Funaria with variously contorted setae, F. polaris and F. arctica, occur at higher latitudes in North America.  Both occur on mineral soil, sand, or gravelly sand in moist situations such as river banks but, so far, only the former is known from the entrance of lemming burrows although it has been collected elsewhere.  As seen through a hand lens, the two species can be separated in the field by the attenuated leaf tip of F. polaris in sharp contrast to the broad and blunt leaves of F. arctica.</discussion>
