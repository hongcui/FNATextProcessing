Stems often more than 3 cm, central strand present.  Stem leaves appressed when dry, strongly recurved and keeled when moist, monomorphic, ovate-triangular, adaxially grooved along costa, 2–2.5 mm, base scarcely differentiated in shape to ovate, margins nearly plane to recurved at mid leaf, entire, apex broadly acute; costa percurrent to short-excurrent, not fragile, weakly tapering, widened pad of cells absent, adaxial costal cells elongate, 2–3 cells wide at mid leaf, guide cells in 1 layer; basal laminal cells differentiated medially, rectangular, walls thickened and often porose; distal laminal cells 13–15 µm wide, 1:1, papillae usually present, simple, often large, 1–3 centered over lumens, lumens angular, walls irregularly thickened and often trigonous but trigones smaller than lumens, convex on both sides, 1-stratose.  Specialized asexual reproduction absent.  Sexual condition sterile in range of flora.  Sporophytes unknown.  Distal laminal KOH reaction dark red.</description><habitat>Cliffs, outcrops, canyons, limestone, tundra meadow;</habitat><elevation> low to moderate elevations (20–1300 m);</elevation><ca_distribution> Nunavut</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Alaska</us_distribution><global_distribution> w Europe.</global_distribution><discussion>Didymodon maximus is rare and apparently disjunctive to the western British Isles (W.
