Weissia sharpii has many of the characteristics of the European species W. condensa including large distal laminal cells, ca. 10–13 µm, and large mucro, of ca. 7–9 cells; W. sharpii has a reduced peristome, W. condensa is eperistomate or occasionally has a very reduced peristome.  With reciprocal transplantation experiments, A. J. Shaw (1987) found W. sharpii and W. controversa to be closely related, but distinguishable by a few discontinuous characters: leaf length-width ratio, distal leaf width, and width of the gap between involute leaf margins.  These are in addition to differences in chromosome number and ecology.</discussion></treatment>
