  <discussion>Bryoerythrophyllum ferruginascens is rather variable in the length of the leaves.
        Reduced specimens are as commonly encountered as the more lush expression. As in B.
        recurvirostrum, unusually short leaves seem to retain their usual width, and these leaves
        then seem broad in proportion to their length and the recurved margin runs higher. Tubers,
        bright red or orange and of variable shape, are often but not always present among the
        rhizoids on the proximal portions of the stems, though asexual reproduction probably occurs
        just as often by the fragile stems, a common trait of arctic species. This essentially
        montane, Arctic species was recently discovered in the Appalachians (P. M. Eckel 1990). It
        can be quickly distinguished from Didymodon vinealis by the adaxial apical costal groove of
        that species, which usually is floored by elongate cells and appears as a rectangular
        light-colored window, and from B. recurvirostrum by the leaves smaller, base squarish and
        lacking inflated cells, distal laminal margins plane, and never with dentate apices (B.
        recurvirostrum may approach B. ferruginascens but usually in at least some leaves there will
        be at least a hint of lateral teeth at the apex). An intermediate (Colorado: Clear Creek
        County, Mt. Evans, Summit Lake, Hermann 24909, Aug. 10, 1972, DUKE) has leaves with broad
        apex, margins recurved nearly throughout and proximal cells fairly well differentiated, but
        is tentatively referred here by the abundant characteristic brood bodies and proximal cells
        rather papillose.</discussion>
