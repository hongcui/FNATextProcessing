  <description>Plants small to medium-sized, in loose or dense tufts, mats or compact sods,
        fragile, dull green, yellowish to dark green distally, black, brown or tan proximally with
        prominent shining costae. Stems erect, often branched, in transverse section with
        hyalodermis, somewhat weak sclerodermis, central strand absent or present, rhizoids dense or
        few at the base, occasionally tomentose; axillary hairs long, 1-seriate, of 10–20 cells,
        hyaline. Stem leaves cirrhate-crispate to incurved when dry, spreading to recurved when
        moist, elongate-oblong to linear-lanceolate or linear-subulate, widest at or near the base;
        base hyaline, oblong, erect; margins plane to incurved distally, generally entire and
        minutely crenulate by projecting papillae, but often slightly or irregularly scalloped by
        indentations at points of laminal weakness, occasionally somewhat to strongly undulate,
        rarely with a border of elongate, clear, smooth cells in one series beyond midleaf,
        gradually tapering distally or more or less abruptly narrowed; apex acute or obtuse,
        cucullate or concave, with an apiculus, mucro or short subula; costa strong, percurrent to
        short-excurrent, adaxial and abaxial epidermal cells often present, often interrupted,
        adaxial and abaxial stereid bands and 1 layer of median guide cells present, hydroid strand
        occasionally present; proximal cells enlarged, laxly long-rectangular, thin-walled, hyaline,
        occasionally brown and rather thick-walled, smooth, abruptly differentiated from the green
        cells distally or gradual in transition, limit of the proximal region usually appears as a
        V, sometimes a U, often extending distally up each leaf margin as a short or elongated
        border; distal laminal cells medially and distally rounded-hexagonal, chlorophyllose,
        frequently obscured by numerous, dense, C-shaped papillae on both surfaces. Specialized
        asexual reproduction at the stem apex occasional, by deciduous or fragile propaguloid leaf
        tips, or by deterioration of fragile leaves along zones of laminal weakness. Sexual
        condition dioicous, occasionally autoicous; perigonia terminal, short-foliose to gemmate or
        as stalked buds in leaf axils of perichaetiate plants; perichaetia terminal, leaves not or
        little differentiated, or distinct and long-setaceous. Seta 1(–2) per perichaetium, yellow
        or reddish proximally with age, to 3 cm, erect, smooth. Capsule erect and symmetric or
        slightly inclined, yellow to reddish brown, darker red or brown at mouth, elliptic to
        cylindric, more or less wrinkled-plicate when dry and empty; annulus sometimes present, of
        1–4 rows of vesiculose cells, persistent; operculum conic or long-rostrate, half as long as
        the urn or longer, straight or inclined; peristome orange-red, single, with a low basal
        membrane, of 32 filiform rami joined at the base into 16 pairs, twisted counterclockwise or
        merely obliquely inclined, branched-spiculose, rarely nearly smooth. Calyptra cucullate,
        smooth. Spores 8–12(–20) µm, yellowish brown, moderately coarsely to finely papillose to
        nearly smooth.</description>

  <discussion>Trichostomum is similar to Tortella in leaf shape and margin flexion, but has distal
        laminal cells differentiated from the proximal cells in a line straight across the leaf base
        or in a low, poorly defined U shape, i.e., straight across but with some smooth, hyaline,
        elongated proximal cells extending up the leaf margins distal to the leaf shoulder. The
        proximal-cell line of differentiation usually forms a distinct V shape in Tortella. The
        peristomes of Trichostomum are erect, often short and frequently smooth, whereas those of
        Tortella are long and twisted generally 2–3 times (only slightly so in T. flavovirens) and
        densely spiculose in noncleistocarpous species (see R. H. Zander 1993). In much of the
        literature the peristomes of Tortella are described as papillose, when they are actually
        spiculose.</discussion>
  <discussion>Pleurochaete does not have the V-shaped area of differentiated hyaline proximal
        echlorophyllose cells as with Tortella, but has a median area of gradually differentiated
        proximal cells and a strong border of several rows of cells contrasting with both laminal
        and proximal cells in being abruptly longer, thinner-walled, smooth and without chlorophyll.
        Pleurochaete also has perichaetia, in addition to perigonia, borne laterally on short
        branches on the main axis of the plant.</discussion>
  <discussion>Species in Weissia are similar to Tortella by the incurving leaf margins (generally
        strongly and sharply incurved throughout the leaf length) with a tendency toward cucullation
        in the leaf apex. The proximal cells of some Weissia species may extend slightly up the
        margins, as in species of Trichostomum, and most especially, Weissia jamaicensis resembles a
        Tortella by a proximal region with a V shape. In the following treatment, great emphasis has
        been put on the cross section of the distal region of the leaf in delimiting taxa and for
        discussing relationships.</discussion>
