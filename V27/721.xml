  <discussion>Species 53 (7 in the flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>Trichostomum is similar to Tortella in leaf shape and margin flexion, but has distal
        laminal cells differentiated from the proximal cells in a line straight across the leaf base
        or in a low, poorly defined U shape, i.e., straight across but with some smooth, hyaline,
        elongated proximal cells extending up the leaf margins distal to the leaf shoulder. The
        proximal-cell line of differentiation usually forms a distinct V shape in Tortella. The
        peristomes of Trichostomum are erect, often short and frequently smooth, whereas those of
        Tortella are long and twisted generally 2–3 times (only slightly so in T. flavovirens) and
        densely spiculose in noncleistocarpous species (see R. H. Zander 1993). In much of the
        literature the peristomes of Tortella are described as papillose, when they are actually
        spiculose.</discussion>
  <discussion>Pleurochaete does not have the V-shaped area of differentiated hyaline proximal
        echlorophyllose cells as with Tortella, but has a median area of gradually differentiated
        proximal cells and a strong border of several rows of cells contrasting with both laminal
        and proximal cells in being abruptly longer, thinner-walled, smooth and without chlorophyll.
        Pleurochaete also has perichaetia, in addition to perigonia, borne laterally on short
        branches on the main axis of the plant.</discussion>
  <discussion>Species in Weissia are similar to Tortella by the incurving leaf margins (generally
        strongly and sharply incurved throughout the leaf length) with a tendency toward cucullation
        in the leaf apex. The proximal cells of some Weissia species may extend slightly up the
        margins, as in species of Trichostomum, and most especially, Weissia jamaicensis resembles a
        Tortella by a proximal region with a V shape. In the following treatment, great emphasis has
        been put on the cross section of the distal region of the leaf in delimiting taxa and for
        discussing relationships.</discussion>
