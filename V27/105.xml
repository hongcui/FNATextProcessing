  <discussion>In the range of Sphagnum talbotianum, there are potentially three other species of sect. Acutifolia with quinquefarious branch leaves.  Sphagnum rubellum has branch leaves somewhat subsecund and less strictly 5-ranked.  It is also not clear whether there is even range overlap.  Sphagnum quinquefarium has a more triangular stem leaf, and has some branch fascicles with three spreading branches.  Sphagnum warnstorfii is most similar but macroscopically has a somewhat larger stem leaf.  Microscopically, S. warnstorfii is readily distinguished by its tiny branch leaf pores.</discussion>
