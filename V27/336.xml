  <discussion>Grimmia nevadensis is a rare but locally abundant endemic, known only from the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  Fertile specimens of it can be separated from G. mariniana by the absence of peristome teeth and by the chestnut brown capsules.  Gametophytically, specimens of G. nevadensis contrast with those of G. mariniana by having a uniform basal areolation of short-rectangular cells with thin lateral walls, and margins not hyaline.  If fertile, the immersed, eperistomate capsules will separate G. nevadensis from G. ovalis, G. alpestris, and G. montana.  Sterile specimens can be separated from G. alpestris by the absence of bulging cells, and the uniformly short-rectangular, thin-walled basal laminal cells.  While both G. nevadensis and G. montana have plane to incurved distal margins and both lack bulging laminal cells, the uniformly short-rectangular, thin-walled basal laminal cells and concave leaves will identify G. nevadensis.  The latter is easily separated from G. arizonae and G. pilifera, in contrast with which it lacks stomata and peristome teeth, and its concave leaves with plane to incurved margins differ markedly from the keeled leaves with recurved leaf margins of the others.</discussion>
