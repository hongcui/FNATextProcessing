  <discussion>W. L. Peterson (1979) recorded Dicranum ontariense from Alberta. This is a North
        American endemic species that was previously mistaken for D. drummondii Müller Hal., a
        predominately Eurasian species which was unknown on this continent until it was discovered
        just recently on the Aleutians Islands. Peterson (1977) clarified the taxonomic position of
        D. ontariense, while P. Isoviita (1977) amplified on the complex nomenclatural details of
        why it must be recognized as a species distinct from D. drummondii. The main distinguishing
        features of D. ontariense are the dark to light green, dull, falcate-secund, flexuose
        tipped, slightly undulate leaves, contorted when dry, keeled above from a lanceolate base to
        a long-acumination, the leaf apices papillose to spinose above on abaxial surface, the
        laminae 1-stratose except for occasional 2-stratose regions on margins, the leaf margins
        plane, strongly serrate above, and the usually multiple sporophytes, 2–5 per perichaetium.</discussion>
  <discussion>This species is sometimes confused with an environmental form of Dicranum undulatum
        that has nearly percurrent costae and ± acute apices. The aggregate setae of D. ontariense
        will immediately distinguish it from that form, which has solitary setae. The dull leaves
        that are contorted when dry, and the leaf apices that are long-acuminate, abundantly spinose
        on the abaxial surface, are other superficial features to distinguish it from D. undulatum,
        which has shiny, usually broadly acute, smooth or serrulate leaf apices. Also, on occasion,
        D. ontariense can be confused with large forms of D. condensatum when sterile. The
        thin-walled, short-rectangular to quadrate distal-median cells in more or less regular rows
        of the former will distinguish it from the latter, which has irregularly shaped cells that
        are thick-walled and usually not in well defined rows. When fruiting, the aggregate setae on
        some of the plants of D. ontariense will immediately distinguish it from D. condensatum,
        which has solitary setae.</discussion>
