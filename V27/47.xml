Stems dark brown; super-ficial cortex of 3–4 layers of enlarged thin-walled cells.  Stem leaves lingulate,small, equal to or less than 0.8 mm, appressed to stem; apex with strong lacerate split in the middle; hyaline cells efibrillose, aporose, and nonseptate.  Branches strongly 5-ranked, short and blunt, not much elongated at distal end.  Branch fascicles with 2 spreading and 2–3 pendent branches.  Branch stems green, with cortex enlarged with retort cells.  Branch leaves ovate; usually less than 1.5 mm; stiff and slightly reflexed, straight to slightly subsecund; margins entire; hyaline cells moderately long and narrow (6–8:1), convex surface with one small round pore per cell at apex and numerous pseudopores on the margin, concave surface with large round wall thinnings in the cell angles and ends; chlorophyllous cells triangular in transverse section, with apex reaching concave surface.  Sexual condition unknown.  Spores not seen.</description><habitat>Common forming hummocks and carpets in a variety of weakly minerotrophic to ombrotrophic mires including Eriophorum tussock fens, dwarf shrub fens, polygon peatlands, string mires and raised bogs;</habitat><elevation> low to moderate elevations;</elevation><global_distribution> Greenland</global_distribution><ca_distribution> Nfld. and Labr.

This species is easily distinguished from the similar S. lindbergii by its compact growth form and reddish brown color.  Sphagnum lenense also is a hummock former in the tundra whereas S. lindbergii forms carpets.</discussion></treatment>
