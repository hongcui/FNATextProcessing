Leaves lingulate, elliptic, broadly ovate, ovate- or oblong-lanceolate to broadly or occasionally narrowly lanceolate; margins 1–2(–4)-stratose, recurved, reflexed, incurved or plane on both sides; apices narrowly to broadly rounded-obtuse or long acuminate to acute, muticous or very rarely shortly hyaline-tipped, entire or sharply to bluntly, remotely irregularly toothed, erose-dentate, sinuate to cristate in the upper 1/5–1/4; costa strong and broad, ceasing in mid leaf to subpercurrent, in transverse-section 2–4-stratose in the distal and medial parts, weakly to strongly convex, reniform, crescent-shaped to semi-terete abaxially, flat or convex on the adaxial side, in the basal part 3–6(–7)-layered, situated at the bottom of a shallow or deeper, usually wide-angled groove, lunate, reniform or rectangular and distinctly flattened, strongly convex on the abaxial side; basal marginal laminal cells not differentiated; distal laminal cells 1- to variously 2-stratose, irregularly rounded-quadrate, subquadrate, oval to rounded-hexagonal, strongly papillose to smooth, straight-walled in the distal part.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 9 (6 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America (Colombia)</global_distribution><global_distribution> Eurasia</global_distribution><global_distribution> n Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution> Atlantic Islands (Azores, Canary Islands, Iceland, Madeira).</global_distribution><discussion>Members of sect. Codriophorus are recognized by their lingulate, broadly ovate to ovate- or oblong-lanceolate leaves, isodiametric and straight-walled distal laminal cells, and costa that is broad and robust, usually over 100 µm wide at the base.  The costa is situated in a shallow, wide-angled groove and is mostly 2–4-stratose in the distal and medial parts, 3–6(–7)-stratose in the basal part, and anatomically strongly differentiated.</discussion><key><key_statement><statement_id>1.</statement_id><statement>Laminal cells smooth or very slightly papillose on young leaves; leaf margins entire or with a few irregular teeth at the apex</statement><determination>5.
