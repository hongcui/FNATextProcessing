  <description>Plants small, gracile, and rather delicate in appearance, green to brownish green.
        Stems to 2 cm. Leaves 2.5–6 × 0.7–1.5 mm, lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate, plane or rarely
        weakly undulate, teeth few and scattered on abaxial surface of lamina or absent, the apex
        acute, proximal leaves somewhat obtuse; border narrow, with small, rather distant marginal
        teeth; costa subpercurrent to percurrent, with several abaxial teeth near apex; lamellae
        2–5, 4–7 cells high; median leaf cells 19–24 µm wide, laxly subquadrate to irregularly
        hexagonal, evenly thin-walled, not or weakly collenchymatous, becoming somewhat larger
        adjacent to the costa, smooth. Sexual condition dioicous; male plants about same size as
        female, perigonial bracts broad, forming a cup-like inflorescence, sometimes more than one
        per plant. Seta 1(–2) per perichaetium, to 2 cm. Capsule 1–2 × 0.5–0.8 mm, erect to
        inclined, straight to somewhat curved; operculum 1.5–2 mm. Spores 15–30 µm.</description>

  <discussion>Atrichum tenellum is a species with few distinguishing features, evidently rather
        rare (or seldom collected), with comparatively few lamellae, a narrow leaf border,
        thin-walled median leaf cells without trigones, and abaxial teeth few or absent. Previously
        confused with A. crispum, it is easily distinguished by the absence of papillae on the
        marginal teeth and border. In addition, the lamellae of A. crispum are always low and
        discontinuous.</discussion>
