  <discussion>Variety blissii is known only from the type collection, Nunavut, Cornwallis Island, Resolute Bay area.  It differs from the typical variety by blackish gametophyte, short-elliptic (not broadly obovate) leaves that are apiculate (never grading to short-awned), costa slightly wider, seta shorter and thicker, operculum larger.  The leaves of var. blissii are identical to those of muticous-leaved forms of the typical variety, but show a very strong color reaction to KOH: bright yellow upper lamina and deep brick-red basal cells, colors which are pale in European specimens.  The short, thick seta is apparently unique to this arctic variety; European specimens have setae 0.7–1.5 mm in length and ca. 0.15 mm in width.  As in European specimens, the capsule is variably macro- and microstomous, and the operculum is broadly to narrowly conic.  The type specimen was incorrectly reported (D. H. Vitt and R. H. Zander 1978) as representing a second known station for Tortula deciduidentata (as Crumia deciduidentata), which has a similar short, thick seta and smooth, weakly bordered leaves that are bright yellow in KOH except for brick-red basal cells, but which differs in the operculum pushed off by the elongating columella; capsule and spores larger; and leaves revolute proximally, with much-enlarged basal cells and costa narrower, sometimes excurrent and sharply truncate.</discussion>
