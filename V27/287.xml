Stems 1–8 cm, sometimes denuded of leaves at base, central strand absent.  Leaves usually curved to falcate, sometimes falcate-secund when dry, linear-lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate, concave proximally, weakly keeled or concave distally, 1.4–5 mm, mainly 2-stratose distally and with 2-stratose strips extending to leaf base adjacent to costa; margins plane or somewhat erect, rarely weakly recurved, smooth, 2-stratose; apices rounded or acute, usually ending in a fleshy, multistratose apiculus, rarely tipped with a short, denticulate awn; costa percurrent, rarely short-excurrent, smooth; basal marginal cells quadrate or short-rectangular; distal cells quadrate or rounded, often angular, 6–11 µm wide, smooth, sometimes weakly bulging-mammillose, weakly sinuose.  Sexual condition autoicous.  Capsule reddish brown, ovoid, cupulate, or short-cylindric, 1.3–1.8 mm; exothecial cells mostly short-elongate or isodiametric, usually irregularly angular, thin-walled, sometimes trigonous; rim darker colored than capsule wall, often red; stomata absent; peristome patent, 350–600 µm, red, finely papillose, strongly perforated.  Spores 8–13 µm, smooth.</description><phenology>Capsules mature late spring to early summer.</phenology><habitat>  Wet or dry rocks, often along intermittent watercourses;</habitat><elevation> high elevations (2000–3500 m);</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Idaho</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wash</us_distribution><global_distribution> Europe.</global_distribution><discussion>Schistidium cinclidodonteum and the closely related S. occidentale are characterized by the long, often linear-lanceolate and falcate leaves.  Both species often form large, rather flat mats over rock along watercourses.  The proboscis-like (discussed in S. Flowers 1973) fleshy apiculus distinguishes the two from all other species of the genus except S. crassithecium, which differs in having a much smaller apiculus, and more erect, ovate-lanceolate leaves.  Examination of the type of Grimmia pacifica, not recognized here, reveals that the only salient difference between that taxon and S. cinclidodonteum is the presence of a short, denticulate awn.</discussion></treatment>
