  <discussion>Tortella alpicola is associated with a western corridor of both montane and valley habitats, including the western Great Plains, extending in an arc from Arizona to Ellesmere Island.  It is the smallest of the North American Tortellae.  The plants are noted by their small size, absence of tomentum on typical (sterile) stems, broken tips on most of the leaves, vividly shining white leaf bases on the stem in contrast with the deep or bright green of the limb, and large leaf cells (to 14 µm wide).  Small fertile plants of T. tortuosa and T. inclinata have a similar aspect; these also have stiff, awned perichaetial leaves distinct from the cauline leaves.  The large leaf cells and presence of a distinct stem central strand in T. alpicola will differentiate ambiguous specimens from similarly small stems of T. tortuosa and T. fragilis.  The costal anatomy of leaves of T. alpicola shows two sets of characteristics, one for sterile plants and one for fertile (perichaetiate).  In sterile plants, the costal layers (epidermis, stereids and guide cells) are weakly differentiated and in many cases, not differentiated at all; the costa is undifferentiated in the proximal part of the leaf where the laminae are fully extended and 1-stratose.  The laminae are never fully 2-stratose but occasionally exhibit 2-stratose patches. In sterile plants, the epidermal and guide cell layers may be chlorophyllose and there are papillae on the abaxial surface of the costa.  In T. fragilis, the costal cells become undifferentiated in the nonlaminate subula while the lamina just proximal to the propagulum is 2-stratose.</discussion>
  <discussion>In sterile plants the abaxial stereid band disappears along with the other layers.  In perichaetiate plants the abaxial and adaxial stereid bands are definite, with thick-walled cells.  The adaxial stereid layer, however, appears to quickly disappear in the distal region of the leaf, rather than the epidermal layer, the reverse of every Tortella species in North America (excepting many specimens of T. tortuosa var. fragilifolia).  The two other Tortella species in North America with stem central strands, T. humilis and T. flavovirens, have two well-differentiated, strong stereid bands abaxial and adaxial to the guide cell layer.  The propaguloid modifications of the leaves are different in kind between T. fragilis and T. alpicola.  The propagules of the former species fall as a single unit from leaves disposed all along the stem, whereas those of the latter fall in numerous, fragile, barrel-shaped caducous units of about equal length from the leaf apices.</discussion>
