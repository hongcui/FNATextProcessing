  <description>Plants less than 2.5 mm. Leaves broadly linear to lanceolate, 0.8–2.5 × 0.15–0.4
        mm; margins serrulate to strongly serrate distal to the proximal third; apex slenderly
        acuminate, papillose; costa not always apparent at the base, often filling the acumen,
        percurrent; areolation compact distally; median laminal cells smooth or slightly papillose;
        distal laminal cells somewhat papillose. Capsule with very few stomates, mostly near the
        base. Spores spherical or reniform, 43–107 × 35–75 µm, orange-brown.</description>

  <global_distribution>Variety papillosum has not been considered worthy of recognition (A. J.
        Grout 1928–1940, V. S. Bryan and L. E. Anderson 1957)</global_distribution>
  <global_distribution>a conclusion sustained by the present studies. It was described originally
        because of its narrower leaves and a strongly papillose calyptra</global_distribution>
  <global_distribution>but both characters have been found to vary independently. Variety
        crassinervium shares several characters with Ephemerum sessile (Bruch &amp; Schimper) Müller

  <global_distribution>a relatively common species in Europe</global_distribution>

  <global_distribution>and north Africa. It was reported as occurring in North America (W. S.

  <global_distribution>and plants labeled as such from “central Ohio” were distributed by
        Sullivant and Lesquereux in 1856 as number 21 of their exsiccata series Musci
        Boreali-Americani. Grout commented that number 21 is not E. sessile</global_distribution>
  <global_distribution>and I have found no North American plants that are convincingly E.

  <global_distribution>as distinct from E. crassinervium.</global_distribution>
