  <discussion>Sporophytes are uncommon in Sphagnum obtusum.  This is a quite phenotypically variable species that warrants further investigation, which may result in taxonomic splitting.  The strongly obtuse stem leaf should separate it from any similar species with which it occurs.  Sphagnum mendocinum looks similar phenotypically but there appears to be no range overlap with S. obtusum.  The tiny branch leaf pores, which may seem like no more than pinpricks in the cell surface, easily separate S. obtusum microscopically from other species of sect. Cuspidata.</discussion>
