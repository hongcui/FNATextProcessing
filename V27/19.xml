Stems brown, superficial cortical layer with spiral reinforcing fibrils clearly visible, usually many pores per cell (1–6), comb-fibrils on interior wall.  Stem leaves 1.1 × 1 mm; rarely hemiisophyllous; hyaline cells non-ornamented, frequently septate.  Branches clavate and rounded at distal end.  Branch fascicles with 2 spreading and 2 pendent branches.  Branch stems with hyaline cell comb-lamellae visible on interior cortex wall, cortical cell end walls with conspicuous funnel projections more than 1/2 length of cell, superficial cortical wall aporose.  Branch leaves broadly ovate, 2.4 × 1.7 mm; hyaline cells on convex surface with numerous round pores along the commissures, comb-lamellae on hyaline cell walls where overlying chlorophyllous cells; chlorophyllous cells broadly triangular in transverse section and well-enclosed on the convex surface.  Sexual condition dioicous.  Capsule with pseudostomata.  Spores 22–29 µm; finely papillose on both surfaces; indistinct triradiate ridge on distal surface; proximal laesura 0.5–0.6 spore radius.</description><habitat>Stream channels, shallow ponds, coniferous and hardwood swamps and pocosins;</habitat><elevation> low to moderate elevations;</elevation><us_distribution> Ala.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><us_distribution> La.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.J.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.Y.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.C.</us_distribution><us_distribution> S.C.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Tex.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America.</global_distribution><discussion>Sphagnum portoricense is normally very easily distinguished because of its wet growing habit and strongly clavate branches.</discussion></treatment>
