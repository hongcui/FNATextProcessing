  <description>Plants fairly slender to moderate-sized, green; forming low dense hummocks.  Stems yellowish green; 3 layers of superficial cortical cells.  Stem leaves generally longer than branch leaves, 1.1–1.7 mm, lingulate to lingulate-spathulate, hyaline cells mostly non-septate.  Branches terete.  Branch fascicles of 2 spreading and 1–2 hanging branches.  Branch stems with 1–2 layers of cortical cells.  Branch leaves 1–1.4 mm, broadly ovate, with a narrow involute tip; hyaline cells only slightly bulging on either surface, in proximal half of leaf aporose on convex surface and with large faint pores on concave surface; internal commissural walls distinctly papillose; chlorophyllous cells elliptical to elliptical-triangular in transverse section, enclosed on both surfaces with the widest part in the leaf middle.  Sexual condition dioicous.  Spores ca. 31 µm, ornamented by small somewhat amalgamated granulae.</description>
