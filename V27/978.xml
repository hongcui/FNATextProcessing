Leaves dimorphic; vegetative 2–3 mm; distal lamina oblong to oblong-lanceolate; margins slightly thickened distally, entire; costa in cross section showing ad- and abaxial bands of stereid cells; medial cells distinct, 7–9 µm, bulging adaxially, smooth to slightly bulging or minutely 1-papillose abaxially; teniolae usually distinct at leaf shoulders and above, sometimes weak or interrupted; cancellinae ending in broad angles distally, often appearing truncate, adaxial cells smooth distally; gemmiferous leaves with apices constricted and often with narrow revolute marginal laminae, bearing gemmae only on adaxial surface in a usually conspicuous hairbrush-like tuft.</description><habitat>Not producing sporophytes in flora area.

Its broad, more or less distally truncate cancellinae and gemmae in a hairbrush-like tuft on the adaxial surface of the leaf apex make it easy to recognize.  Calymperes palisotii is represented in the flora area by the subsp. palisotii.</discussion></treatment>
