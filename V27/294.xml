  <discussion>Schistidium frigidum is rather common yet is one of the more difficult taxa to determine with confidence, as the examination of many leaves is often necessary before the elongate basal marginal cells are obvious.  Often, some central basal cells are much lighter than adjacent cells, and are often hyaline, and form contrasting patches, which helps to identify the species.  In contrast to S. dupretii and S. confertum, which have a large proportion of elongate exothecial cells, S. frigidum has exothecial cells that are mainly isodiametric or oblate.</discussion>
