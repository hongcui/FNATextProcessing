Stems 1.3–3(–4) cm, central strand weak or absent.  Leaves usually curved, often falcate-secund, sometimes erect, imbricate when dry, narrowly ovate-lanceolate, keeled distally, 1.7–2.4 mm, 1-stratose to, rarely, 2-stratose in striae distally; margins usually recurved to apex, smooth, usually 2-stratose, sometimes 1-stratose or multistratose; apices acute or sub-obtuse; costa percurrent or excurrent as a smooth or weakly denticulate, usually non-decurrent, flexuose awn, sometimes embracing part of the lamina, smooth; basal marginal cells quadrate or short-rectangular; distal laminal cells quadrate or short-rectangular, 8–10 µm wide, smooth, sinuose.  Sexual condition autoicous.  Capsule orange-brown or red-brown, short-cylindric to cylindric, 0.8–1.3 mm; exothecial cells usually a mix of isodiametric, short-elongate, and oblate cells, thin-walled, walls often curved, usually trigonous; stomata present; peristome recurved to squarrose-recurved, sometimes twisted, 260–430 µm, orange or reddish orange, weakly papillose, usually strongly perforated.  Spores 11–17 µm, granulose.</description><phenology>Capsules mature late spring to early summer.</phenology><habitat>  Dry to seasonally moist rocks and ledges;</habitat><elevation> low to moderate elevations (0–500 m);</elevation><global_distribution> Greenland</global_distribution><ca_distribution> Nfld. and Labr.

Its short, narrow, and smooth-margined leaves also help to distinguish is from the closely related S. apocarpum.</discussion></treatment>
