  <discussion>The population in the Appalachian Mountains differs by greenish, not blackish
        plants, smaller size, less developed alar cells and less incrassate, basal laminal cell
        walls. Such plants have been described from similar habitats and similar elevations from the
        Alps of Europe as Campylopus adustus De Notaris. It is not known whether these populations
        in non-coastal areas are genotypically different or just modifications associated with
        higher elevations. It may perhaps deserve to be recognized at the varietal rank. Forms with
        falcate leaves as occurring in Europe or Asia have not yet been found in North America.
        Sporophytes, produced very rarely, were found in North America only once, in British
        Columbia</discussion>
