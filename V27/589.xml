  <discussion>Dicranum elongatum is easy to recognize because the plants are relatively small, slender, glossy, and grow in dense, compact tufts.  The leaves are short, narrow, usually less than 6 × 0.5 mm, ending in a long, fine, tubulose subula, acute at the apex, smooth or nearly so on the abaxial surface, and have entire margins or rarely some denticulations at the apex.  Capsules, which are not uncommon on plants in some arctic localities, are short, less than 2 mm, straight and erect to slightly arcuate, smooth but striate when dry.</discussion>
  <discussion>Dicranum elongatum can readily be confused with the closely related D. groenlandicum.  They both are arctic-alpine species sharing nearly the same type of habitat with almost the same distribution.  They can usually be readily distinguished in their typical form but there appear to be many intergradations that cause difficulty.  Dicranum groenlandicum has narrowly obtuse leaf apices and cells that are pitted to well above the middle of the leaf in contrast to the acute leaf apices and cells that are pitted only up to the middle of the leaf in D. elongatum. E. Hegewald (1972) found that the pits in the leaf are the most reliable means of separating difficult specimens of Finnish plants. H. A. Crum and L. E. Anderson (1981) expressed doubt as to whether the two are genetically different.  Both D. elongatum and D. groenlandicum often bear at the apex of some stems julaceous shoots with small, ovate, broad leaves with obtuse apices.  This can lead to the misidentification of some plants of D. elongatum unless the leaves in the basal part of the stems are always used to determine the shape of the leaf apices.</discussion>
