Often the distal margins are sharply incurved (a sharp inflexion seen in section) and although the gametophyte has the appearance otherwise of Trichostomum crispulum, the largely plane (or broadly incurved) distal margins may be taken as a secondary character, perhaps a reduction.  Weissia ludoviciana, likewise, has largely plane distal leaf margins, but inflexion may be evident in some specimens.  In addition, the very long and narrow leaves of W. brachycarpa and W. ludoviciana are not duplicated in Trichostomum except in the T. tenuirostre complex.  Weissia brachycarpa is cladautoicous, with perigonial buds borne in the axils of lower branches of robust fruiting plants.  Weissia brachycarpa is related to W. rutilans of the Old World by the nearly identical gametophytes; the latter species differs in the rudimentary peristome teeth, and slightly larger spores.  The nomenclature of W. brachycarpa is intricate; see discussions by M. O. Hill (1981) and T. J. Koponen et al. (1977).</discussion></treatment>
