It proved, in fact, to be a form intermediate between these species.  It occurs in North America and Russia, although at the present time the geographic range in Russia is little known.  Based on the North American material examined it appears to be found only in areas where both T. pellucida and T. geniculata occur, suggesting that it might be found in the Russian Far East where the two species also overlap.</discussion></treatment>
