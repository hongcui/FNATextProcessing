  <discussion>Encalypta mutica is a tiny species found on soil in naturally disturbed areas.  It might be confused with E. flowersiana as both taxa are absent leaf awn and peristome, but E. mutica has much shorter leaves, smaller spores with granulate ornamentation, and an almost smooth capsule.</discussion>
