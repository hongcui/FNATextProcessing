Leaves oblong-ovate to lanceolate, 2–4 mm; apices acute to acuminate, mu-cronate to apiculate; margins plane; costa percurrent to ex-current, narrow, papillose; laminal cells 8–16 µm; basal cells long-rectangular, smooth; basal marginal cells weakly differentiated, longer than laminal cells forming border in leaf base.  Specialized asexual reproduction absent.  Seta 6–12 mm, brownish red to black.  Capsule cylindric, 1–3  mm, ribbed, gymnostomous, brown; exothecial cells rectangular, walls thickened; peristome absent; operculum 1.5 mm.  Calyptra 3–6 mm, lacerate at base, smooth.  Spores 30–36 µm, irregular granulate, brown.</description><habitat>Mesic sites, soil and rock around waterfalls and seeps in mountain and alpine habitats;</habitat><global_distribution> Greenland</global_distribution><ca_distribution> Alta.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Man.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Nfld. and Labr.

It might be confused with E. rhaptocarpa, but that species has a longer awn, ribbed capsule, and peristome.</discussion></treatment>
