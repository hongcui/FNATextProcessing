  <discussion>Bucklandiella brevipes is stenotypic, well-characterized by its canaliculate and very robust costa that is 100–120 µm wide near the base with 6–9 enlarged adaxial cells, very stout, broad and decurrent awns, and coarsely denticulate, spinulose, and prominently pseudopapillose laminal cells.  It cannot be mistaken for any local species of the genus.  Bucklandiella occidentalis has a weaker costa, 70–90 µm wide basally, which is distinctly asymmetric on the abaxial side with low wings and furrows, narrower and non-decurrent awns, and smooth laminal cells.  Bucklandiella macounii is muticous or has very short, yellowish hair-points, very robust, 4-stratose, terete costae, and not or only slightly pseudopapillose laminal cells.  Bucklandiella brevipes has been considered as a form of B. sudetica (E. Lawton 1972), as both species share a consistently 2-stratose leaf margin and short and pseudopapillose distal leaf cells.  However, the latter has a narrower costa, 60–90 µm wide near the base, which is terete in outline, not flattened.  Bucklandiella heterosticha has a similarly broad costa but it differs at once from B. brevipes in its 1-stratose leaf margins, not or slightly pseudopapillose leaf cells, and much less spinulose awns.</discussion>
