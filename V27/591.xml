  <discussion>Dicranum fragilifolium is a rare boreal species with shiny, light green to yellowish brown, erect-spreading leaves.  The distal portion of the leaves is fragile and often broken off, thereby giving the plants a distinctive appearance.  The deciduous leaf apices presumably serve as a type of asexual reproduction by regenerating to produce new plants.  The species is often confused with D. tauricum, another species with deciduous leaf tips, but the latter occurs only in western North America.  Where their ranges overlap they frequently are difficult to tell apart.  When sporophytes are present the straight capsules of D. tauricum are distinctive from the usually arcuate ones of D. fragilifolium, which unfortunately rarely produces them.  When sterile, the best way to separate the two is by the costa cross section in the proximal half of the leaf: D. fragilifolium has stereid cells in two thin bands while D. tauricum has none.  Also, in D. fragilifolium there are 2â€“3 layers of cells above and below the guide cells, while in D. tauricum there are 1 or rarely 2 layers of cells.  One other species with deciduous leaf tips that has sometimes been confused with D. fragilifolium is D. viride of eastern North America.  It has a straight capsule like D. tauricum but as in D. fragilifolium capsules are rarely produced.  The broad costa of D. viride, covering 1/3 or more of the leaf base, will distinguish it from D. fragilifolium, the costa of which covers 1/4 or less of the leaf base.</discussion>
