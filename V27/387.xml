  <discussion>Subspecies macounii is a montane moss occurring in western North America in the coastal region from Vancouver Island to northern California, and in the Rocky Mountains from southern Alaska to Colorado.  The taxon is readily recognized by its characteristic habit including fairly robust, dull, distally more olivaceous plants with distinctly crisped leaves.  Moreover, the awns are usually absent or very short, less than 0.1 mm, and strongly spinulose, the costa is very robust and broad, 80–100, sometimes to 150 µm wide near the base, the capsule is obloid to short-cylindric, 1.7–1.9 mm, and the peristome teeth are very short, about 330 µm.</discussion>
