  <discussion>Didymodon perobtusus is an extremely rare species known in the flora area from only two stations: Northwest Territories, Mackenzie District, Nahanni National Park, Virginia Falls, Scotter 22433 (NY); and Yukon, Firth River basin, near mouth of Mancha Creek, 68°40’N, 141°W, Sharp MC-58152a pro parte, 1958 (NY).  It has several characters in common with D. revolutus of the southwestern United States and Mexico, including leaf and laminal papillae shape and unicellular gemmae borne in dense axillary clusters; however, D. revolutus differs by the strongly recurved to revolute margins, leaf cells with thin, light yellow walls, and gemmiferous plants uncommon, the propagula all unicellular.  Both North American collections seen were from stations at which D. subandreaeoides is also present, growing in separate or occasionally confluent cushions.  The taxonomic position of D. perobtusus is not clear.  It is here placed near D. subandreaeoides because of dark, reddish color and similarity of areolation and laminal papillae.  It may, however, turn out to be related to D. tophaceus, with which it has a certain resemblance.</discussion>
