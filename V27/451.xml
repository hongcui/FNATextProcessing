  <description>Plants tiny, olive green to light green.  Leaves lanceolate, to ovate-lanceolate, often stoutly subulate from broader base, narrowly obtuse to broadly acute; costa ending in apex or filling it; margins entire to crenulate; leaf cells (1–)2:1; perichaetial leaves larger and longer than vegetative leaves, somewhat differentiated.  Seta 1–1.5 mm, slightly curved, stout.  Capsule hemispheric to obovate-turbinate, flaring at mouth when old; peristome of 16, broad, well-developed teeth; columella exserted.  Spores (15–)18–24 µm.</description>

  <discussion>Seligeria tristichoides is relatively frequent in Alaska and western Canada, and is disjunct in Colorado, and in the east ranges from Newfoundland south to Vermont.  This tiny gregarious species has a persistent columella and well-developed peristome.  These features, along with the turbinate capsules and subulate vegetative leaves with costa filling the apex, are diagnostic.  As the epithet attests, the leaves are often somewhat three-ranked.</discussion>
