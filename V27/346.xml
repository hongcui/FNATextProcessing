  <discussion>Grimmia hartmanii is principally a lowland species, occurring in the mountains up to 1500 m.  With the separation of G. anomala from it, G. hartmanii is much less common in North America than was previously thought.  It is known principally from the Northeast.  Although it is usually found in densely shaded habitats, in areas with high humidity it can establish itself in exposed sites.  It more closely resembles some species of Racomitrioideae than it does species of its own genus, but it may be recognized by the usually spreading falcate-secund distal leaves, the very small awns, and the terminal clusters of brown gemmae, which are conspicuous and usually present.  Capsules are extremely rare, and are unknown in North America.</discussion>
