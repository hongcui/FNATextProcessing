  <discussion>Hymenostylium recurvirostrum is distinctive among similar species in having one laminal margin typically recurved, the other erect.  A character often overlooked in texts is the universal presence of a long, narrow, fragile decurrency in the basal angles.  Both Gymnostomum aeruginosum and Eucladium verticillatum have an adaxial epidermis in the costal section, with papillose and quadrate cells on the adaxial surface of the costa in plane view, and the costa profile is round (convex), but Hymenostylium has long, thin and smooth cells in plane view because the epidermal layer is not developed, and the costal profile is convex adaxially, being lunate in section.  In Anoectangium aestivum, as in those two species, the dense laminal papillae often obscure cell lumens, but the leaf section shows a very deeply keeled leaf with the leaf lamina adjacent to the costa nearly contiguous or touching, showing a deep, narrow channel in plane view and a circular costa section.  The adaxial stereid band is always absent in A. aestivum, but often present in H. recurvirostrum.  Molendoa sendtneriana is similar but has a stem central strand, and lateral perichaetia (like A. aestivum).</discussion>
