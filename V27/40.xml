    <description>Plants slender and weak-stemmed, moderate-sized, flaccid and plumose in aquatic
        forms to more compact in emergent forms, spreading branches often con-spicuously falcate,
        giving capitulum a twisted appearance; green to yellow, often tinged with red, red-brown or
        brown in capitula. Stems green; superficial cortex of 2–3 layers, 2 layers of enlarged
        thin-walled cells. Stem leaves triangular-ovate, more than 1.2 mm, usually appressed; apex
        acute to apiculate, hyaline cells rarely septate or porose, apical region often fibrillose.
        Branches mostly unranked to weakly 5-ranked, often conspicuously falcate, leaves greatly
        elongated at distal end. Branch fascicles with 2 spreading and 2–3 pendent branches. Branch
        stems green, but often pinkish at the proximal ends, with cortex enlarged with conspicuous
        retort cells. Branch leaves ovate-lanceolate to lanceolate, 1.6–5 mm, falcate toward branch
        tips, when dry often undulate and recurved, rarely weakly serrulate along the margins in
        submerged forms, leaves from middle of spreading branches with length to width ratio less
        than or equal to 1:0.28; hyaline cells length to width ratio in apical convex surface region
        8:1 or more, convex surface with 0–1 small round pores at apex, concave surface with faint
        round wall thinnings in cell apices and angles; chlorophyllous cells triangular to
        trapezoidal in transverse section, broadly exposed on the convex surface and exposed
        slightly on the concave surface. Sexual condition dioicous. Spores 29–38 µm; covered with
        large papillae on both surfaces, appearing pusticulate; proximal laesura less than 0.5 spore
        radius.</description>

    <discussion>Distinguishing Sphagnum cuspidatum from S. viride is sometimes difficult, as both
        occur over a similar geographic range and both grow in wet carpets. Sphagnum cuspidatum has
        narrower branch leaves and usually a distinct red tinge at the branch bases within the
        capitulum.</discussion>
