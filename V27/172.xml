  <discussion>Polytrichum piliferum is easily recognized by its habit, growing in short, loose reddish brown clumps, each plant crowned by a whitish tuft of intertwined hyaline awns.  The intensely colored, wine-red antheridial rosettes are remarkably flower-like in appearance.  The lamella marginal cells are pyriform in section, ending in a distinct knob, except for the lamellae standing in the shade of the inflexed lamina.  The leaves of P. piliferum are smooth abaxially and abruptly contracted to the base of the awn; P. juniperinum is a larger plant with reddish rather than hyaline awns; P. hyperboreum is typically fastigiately branched, the leaves with a channeled leaf apex, tapering to a bicolored awn.  In Nunavut, it is known from Baffin and Melville islands.</discussion>
