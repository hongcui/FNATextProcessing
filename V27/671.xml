Buck</author><description>Plants scattered or in loose to compact turfs, mostly yellowish green, sometimes reddish.  Stems erect, to ca. 0.5 mm, sometimes seemingly absent; simple or branched by innovations; rhizoids at base, smooth.  Leaves imbricate to spreading when dry, lanceolate to ovate, acute to subulate; margins plane, entire or serrate; costa subpercurrent to excurrent, sometimes weak or absent toward insertion and in lowermost leaves,  medial laminal cells rhomboidal to short-rectangular, becoming longer toward the insertion, smooth.  Specialized asexual reproduction unknown.  Sexual condition autoicous or dioicous, cladocarpous; perichaetial leaves sometimes differentiated.  Seta short, curved at apex, rarely ± erect.  Capsule pendulous and laterally emergent, rarely erect and immersed, reddish at maturity, subglobose; annulus near midurn, of 1–2 rows of small cells, persistent; operculum obtuse to apiculate; peristome none.  Calyptra conic-mitrate, entire at base or crenate-lobed.  Spores globose to reniform, coarsely papillose to reticulate.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 6 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution> Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution> Australia.</global_distribution><references heading="SELECTED REFERENCE"><reference>Crum, H.
