  <discussion>Eccremidium floridanum is known in the flora area only from the Panhandle of Florida and southern Georgia.  It may well be more widespread in the Southeast but appears to be ephemeral, and the plants often die down by early spring, prior to the arrival of most collectors.  The species may be the same as the Australian and South African E. exiguum (Hooker f. &amp; Wilson) Wilson, with which it has much in common.  In the field, American material looks different from Australian material; in the former the leaves of fresh plants are decidedly more subsecund.  The distinctive characters of this species include its minute size, arcuate setae and laterally emergent capsules dehiscent near mid urn without a peristome.</discussion>
