Schofield</author><description>Plants microscopic, annual or perennial from persistent protonema.  Archegoniate plants composed of a perichaetium of a few, mainly non-chlorophyllose ecostate leaves that enclose very few archegonia.  Antheridial plants reduced to a 1-stratose, 2-lipped structure enclosing a single spherical antheridium, arising from a short branch of the protonema.  Seta elongate.  Capsule usually obliquely oriented, upper face flat or bulging and often distinguished from lower face by a perimeter ridge, broadly ovate to lance-cylindric; operculum conic, nearly perpendicular to upper face of capsule; peristome with endostome 16-pleated, a hyaline cone, exostome of one or more rows of articulated teeth, irregular in number, sometimes rudimentary.  Calyptra smooth, conic, barely covering operculum, early deciduous.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Genus 1, species 12 (4 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> widely distributed in temperate to subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere</global_distribution><global_distribution> scattered in the tropics</global_distribution><us_distribution> Pacific Islands (New Zealand)</us_distribution><global_distribution> Australia.</global_distribution></treatment>
