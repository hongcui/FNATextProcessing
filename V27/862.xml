  <description type="morphology">Leaves oblong-lanceolate to long-elliptical, apex acute, mucronate, margins
        recurved at base, bordered in proximal 2/3 to throughout with 3–5 rows of thicker-walled

  <discussion>Forms of Tortula subulata may approach T. mucronifolia in the indistinct laminal
        border, though the laminal cells are quite papillose. The European var. angustata (Schimper)
        Limpricht, characterized by narrower leaves, a more acute, denticulate apex, with a stronger
        border, is not recognized here because North American plants that approach this variant
        fully intergrade with the typical variety (see discussion by W. C. Steere 1939c). The former
        has recently been recognized on the basis of molecular data by M. J. Cano et al. (2005)
        under the name T. schimperi Cano, Werner &amp; Guerra. The cladogram branch arrangement,
        however, had only a 0.77 posterior probability of not being imbedded among specimens of T.
        subulata and only one morphological trait (the 2-stratose basal leaf margin) was selected
        post hoc as meaningful, a multiple test problem in statistics. Of the six specimens of T.
        schimperi analyzed and molecularly segregated, four were from Europe and two from
        California, which indicates at least one shared molecular trait. Further research, however,
        is needed, given odd segregation patterns in T. subulata in the strict sense.</discussion>
