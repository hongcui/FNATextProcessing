S. Salmon</species_authority></TaxonIdentification><description>Plants in loose to rather dense pure tufts, dull olive green, becoming dark reddish brown with age.  Stems 3–10 cm, arising from a short, erect tuberous rhizome, slender and thread-like, distantly bracteate and appearing almost leafless proximally, ± abruptly leafy distally.  Leaves loosely imbricate, 4–6 mm, linear-lanceolate from a sheathing base, the sheath yellowish and nitid, clasping stem; limb reflexed at the shoulders, subtubulose, twisted and contorted when dry, widely spreading and almost plane when moist; costa slender, percurrent, smooth abaxially, ending in a short spine; margins of sheath entire proximally, not hyaline-margined, at shoulders cilia 1-seriate, 0.4–0.6 mm, cells distinctly papillose; no hinge tissue; margins of limb plane, serrations ending in a conical tooth cell, sometimes with 1–2 short cilia near the shoulders; lamina 2-stratose except for a narrow strip just within the margin and locally 1-stratose streaks and patches, adaxial layer of cells strongly bulging mammillose in indistinct longitudinal rows; lamellae 4–5(–9), restricted to the costa, 4–8(–10) cells high, serrations ending in a small toothed cell; sheath cells linear at margin, the median short-rectangular, 23–28 × 6–9 µm; abaxial laminal cells irregularly arranged, subquadrate, 6–10(–12) µm, walls evenly thickened and firm; abaxial costal cells sharply differentiated, narrowly elongate to linear, 25–33(–55) × 5–6 µm.  Sexual condition dioicous; male plants like the female, male inflorescence inconspicuous, several to a shoot, separated by sectors with normal vegetative leaves, perigonial bracts with a broader sheath, but otherwise like the leaves; perichaetial leaves scarcely differentiated.  Seta rather stout, 7–12 mm.  Capsule yellowish brown, erect, 2.5–4 mm, widest at the mouth; exothecial cells short-rectangular, 40–62 × 26–30 µm, smaller and ± isodiametric below mouth, smooth; stomata superficial, confined to the tapering neck; operculum almost as large as urn, beak about 1 mm; peristome none; columella broadly flaring, extending to capsule rim.  Calyptra cucullate.</description><habitat>Soil banks or soil over rock, exposed tree roots;</habitat><elevation> usually low to moderate elevations;</elevation><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Alaska</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wash.</us_distribution><global_distribution> e Asia (Japan, Russia in Kamtschatka).</global_distribution></treatment>
