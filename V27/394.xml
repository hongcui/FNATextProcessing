  <discussion>Subspecies canescens occurs across the continent from British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon to Newfoundland, with the southernmost extensions to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and the northernmost station at Lake Iliamna in southern Alaska.  It is highly variable; doubtless the differing phenotypes are reactions to varying environmental conditions.  The most common phenotype comprises robust plants with broad and typically concave leaves that are falcate along the whole stem and are long-pilose with awns that merge with large hyaline apical parts of the leaves.  The opposite extreme is plants with thin shoots and almost elliptical, non-falcate, spoon-shaped, and cucullate leaves that have a short and strait awn or are muticous.</discussion>
