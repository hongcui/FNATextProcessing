  <discussion>The collection from Alberta (Drummond’s Musci Americani 89, TENN) is probably incorrectly labeled as to locality.</discussion>
  <discussion>Large, tall cushions distinguish Leucobryum glaucum and under favorable circumstances some cushions may exceed 1 m in diameter.  The separation of smaller, shorter plants from L. albidum is difficult.  The use of the number of layers of leucocysts on both sides of the chlorocysts is highly variable and not a reliable distinguishing feature.  The ratio of length of the sheath to the length of the limb provides the most consistent way to separate L. glaucum from L. albidum.  Sporophytes are infrequently observed.  Of 1933 collectons examined, 308 (16 percent) had sporophytes.  Most of the plants with sporophytes were from collections located north of the Ohio River.  Leucobryum antillarum Bescherelle var. antillarum has been reported from the Coastal Plain of the United States based upon plants that had only 1 layer of leucocysts on both sides of the chlorocysts across a wide section of the median portion of the leaf as seen in transverse section near the base.  However, this character is quite variable and not even consistent in L. antillarum (H. A. Crum and L. E. Anderson 1981, vol. 2).  Also, plants from the coastal plain do not show the prorate cells on the lateral wings of the lamina that are present in the type material of L. antillarum.</discussion>
