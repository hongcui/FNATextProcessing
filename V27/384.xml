  <description>Plants small, medium-sized to large, fairly slender to coarse and rigid.  Stems 1–13 cm long, prostrate, ascending to erect, sparsely irregularly ramified to almost unbranched.  Leaves lanceolate or ovate-lanceolate, straight to curved; margins recurved on both sides to 1/2–3/4 the leaf length, sometimes to the apex, variously 1–2(–4)-stratose in 1–3(–6) cell rows; muticous or piliferous, awns erect or erect-recurved, not or slightly flexuose, stout, terete, strongly or moderately denticulate or spinulose-denticulate, not or slightly decurrent; costa  3–4-stratose and strongly convex abaxially in the proximal portion; alar cells undifferentiated; basal marginal border present.  Inner perichaetial leaves slightly differentiated, hyaline and sheathing in the proximal portion, chlorophyllose distally, usually piliferous and with the areolation similar to that in the vegetative leaves.  Peristome teeth with a basal membrane.</description>

  <discussion>The slightly differentiated innermost perichaetial bracts that are ovate-lanceolate and similar to the vegetative leaves, the stout, terete or somewhat flattened, not flexuose and variously denticulate and spinulose awn, presence of the basal marginal border, laminal cells tending to be short or very short in the distal portion, and strong, 3–4-stratose costa in the basal part are diagnostic of sect. Sudeticae.</discussion>
