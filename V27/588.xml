  <discussion>Dicranum muehlenbeckii is a somewhat rare species throughout North America, where it is often misidentified as other species of the genus.  There should be no reason for its misidentification if its important characters are utilized for recognition.  Smooth, erect-spreading leaves, cirrate to crisped when dry and tubulose above, smooth leaf cells, 1-stratose laminae, and cross section of the costa showing the abaxial and adaxial rows of cells differentiated, all combine to make the gametophytes different from all other North American species of the genus.  Sporophytes are rarely produced but the 2â€“4 mm, solitary, long-cylindric, slightly strumose capsules, which are suberect to slightly arcuate and weakly striate when dry, are distinctive.</discussion>
