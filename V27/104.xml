  <discussion>Sphagnum subtile forms small dense cushions and hummocks in damp coniferous forests and in the shaded portions of poor fens and ombrotrophic mires.</discussion>
  <discussion>Sporophytes are common in Sphagnum subtile.  Reports that the species is monoicous may be unreliable because of confusion with closely related species (C. B. McQueen 1989).  Previous reports of this species from the west coast of North America are uncertain as well as are specimens from the interior of the continent (R. E. Andrus 1979) due to taxonomic confusion with Sphagnum capillifolium and S. rubellum (McQueen).  However, this species is conspicuously distinct in gametophyte and spore morphology as well as niche.  In the northern part of its range where it overlaps ecologically with S. quinquefarium, the three spreading branches of the latter will distinguish it from S. subtile.  It should be noted that contrary to the opinion of H. A. Crum (1997), S. subtile does not occur throughout the range of S. capillifolium but in North America is found over only a portion of the latterâ€™s eastern range, while being absent completely from its western range.  See also discussion under 71. S. capillifolium.</discussion>
