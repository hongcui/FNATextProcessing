  <description>Plants moderate-sized to robust, with distinct capitulum; green,yellowish brown.  Stems green to dark reddish brown, superficial cortex of 2–4 layers of efibrillose, non-ornamented, enlarged, thin-walled, aporose, rectangular cells.  Stem leaves ovate, ovate-lingulate to lingulate; with broad, fringed apex; little or no border along margins or base; hyaline cells rhomboid, efibrillose, non-ornamented, aporose, usually nonseptate, with resorption gaps on exterior surface.  Branches strongly dimorphic, pendent branches thinner but about same length as spreading branches.  Branch stems green, with cortex surrounded by 1–2 layers of efibrillose, non-ornamented, enlarged, thin-walled cells, some cells apically porose with inconspicuous necks.  Branch leaves strongly squarrose or spreading, ovate, ovate-hastate or ovate-lanceolate, margins entire, apex involute and smooth; hyaline cells fibrillose; with large, round pores at cell ends and along commissures, sometimes with faint papillae on interior walls; chlorophyllous cells ovate-triangular, elliptical to ovate-elliptical in transverse section, more broadly exposed on convex surface, end walls not thickened.  Sexual condition monoicous or dioicous.  Capsule 2 mm or more, with scattered pseudomata.  Spores less than 30 µm, both surfaces smooth to finely papillose; proximal laesura more than 0.5 spore radius.</description>
