Stem unbranched and branched; axillary hyaline nodules absent; central strand weak.  Leaves as many as 35 pairs, lanceolate to oblong-lingulate, acute to obtuse-apiculate; to 5 × 0.9 mm; dorsal lamina narrowed proximally, ending at insertion, not decurrent; vaginant laminae 1/2–2/3 leaf length, equal; margin ± entire, limbate on all laminae, limbidium reaching apex or ending a few cells before apex and a few cells above insertion of dorsal lamina, limbidial cells 3- to 6-stratose; costa ± percurrent, bryoides-type; laminal cells 1-stratose, or variably 2-stratose, smooth, slightly bulging, firm-walled, irregularly quadrate to hexagonal, 8–13 µm, ± twice as deep as wide.  Sexual condition probably rhizautoicous; perigonia not seen; perichaetia on elongate stems.  Sporophytes 1–2 per perichaetium.  Seta stout, to 3 mm, geniculate.  Capsule theca emergent, erect, radially symmetric, to 1.2 mm; peristome bryoides-type; operculum 0.4 mm.  Calyptra not seen.  Spores 23–40 µm.</description><habitat>Attached to rocks and other substrates in rapidly running streams, infrequently on wet rocks beside streams;</habitat><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Idaho</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wash.</us_distribution><discussion>Fissidens ventricosus occurs along the Pacific Coast of North America and at a disjunct site in northern Idaho (see map in R. R. Ireland and W. B. Schofield 1967).  It is distinguished by its aquatic habitat, strongly limbate leaves, variably 2-stratose laminal cells, short, thick, geniculate seta, and emergent capsule.  Plants usually become black and covered with diatoms.  The species might be confused with F. rigidulus Hooker f. &amp; Wilson, but the latter, found in wet sites in the Americas from Chile north to Mexico but not known in the United States, has much smaller laminal cells and a long seta characteristic of terrestrial species.  The calyptra of F. ventricosus is cucullate according to Ireland and Schofield.</discussion></treatment>
