Stems pale green to pale brown, sometimes with red branch bases; superficial cortex of 2 layers of enlarged, clearly differentiated and thin-walled cells.  Stem leaves triangular to lingulate-triangular, 0.8–1.3 mm; typically appressed; apex acute to apiculate; hyaline cells efibrillose and nonseptate to rarely septate.  Branches straight and somewhat tapered, usually 5-ranked; leaves little elongate at the distal branch end.  Branch fascicles with 2 spreading and 2–3 pendent branches.  Branch stems green but often reddish at proximal end, with cortex enlarged with conspicuous retort cells.  Branch leaves ovate to narrowly ovate-lanceolate; (1.1–)1.4–1.8(–3.1) mm; slightly undulate and sharply recurved when dry, somewhat subsecund; margins entire; hyaline cells on convex surface with usually 1 round pore on apical end, on concave surface with wall thinnings in the cell ends and angles; chlorophyllous cells broadly triangular in transverse section and very deeply enclosed on the concave surface.  Sexual condition dioicous.  Spores 19–25 µm; finely papillose on both surfaces.</description><habitat>Forested and open poor fen habitats, often as a ruderal species in extensive mats;</habitat><elevation> low to moderate elevations;</elevation><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Alaska</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><discussion>Sporophytes in Sphagnum pacificum are uncommon.
