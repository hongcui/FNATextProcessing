  <discussion>Fissidens polypodioides is a robust species and has its greatest distribution in the neotropics and Asia.  It is perhaps the handsomest species of the genus in the flora area.  However, it might be confused with F. asplenioides, from which it is distinguished by taxifolius-type costa, leaves crisped but not curled tightly inward when dry, entire leaf margin, acute and more or less equal vaginant laminae, larger laminal cells that are not lenticularly thickened, and absent differentiated medial marginal cells in the vaginant laminae.  The central strand is especially well developed.  H. A. Crum and L. E. Anderson (1965, 1981) published illustrations of F. polypodioides and F. asplenioides that aid greatly in distinguishing the two.</discussion>
