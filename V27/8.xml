    <description>Plants typically large, with distinct capitulum; green, pale green, yellowish, red,
        tan, brown to dark brown. Stems green, brown or reddish, outer cortex of 3–4 layers of
        inflated, thin-walled cells, superficial cells with conspicuous to faint spiral fibrils, no
        or strong ornamention on interior wall, and 1–6 round to ovate pores per cell. Stem leaves
        typically as large as or larger than branch leaves, lingulate to ovate-lingulate with broad
        rounded apex, border fringed; hyaline cells rhomboid, efibrillose or fibrillose, sometimes
        ornamented, aporose, 0–2-septate, and often resorbed on exterior surface. Branches
        dimorphic, spreading branches tumid, pendent branches usually shorter and more slender.
        Branch fascicles with 2–3 spreading branches and 1–3 pendent branches. Branch stems green,
        surrounded by 1 layer of enlarged thin-walled cells, typically porose and fibrillose, in
        some species ornamented on interior wall; retort cells absent. Branch leaves ovate to
        broadly ovate, apex cucullate and roughened on convex surface; margin toothed; hyaline cells
        fibrillose; convex surface pores round to elliptic, usually with 1 at each corner of three
        adjacent hyaline cells; chlorophyllous cells lenticular to triangular, sometimes with wall
        ornamentation visible in transverse section; chlorophyllous cells enclosed, equally exposed,
        or more broadly exposed on concave surface, end walls thickened or unthickened. Sexual
        condition usually dioicous. Capsule 2 mm or more. Spores typically 22–30 µm, distal surface
        sculpture may be present; proximal laesura usually more than 0.5 spore radius.</description>
