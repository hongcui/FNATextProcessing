  <description>Plants in small or sometimes extensive tufts, olivaceous, often with a yellowish or brownish tinge.  Stems 1–3.8 cm, central strand distinct.  Leaves erect or curved, usually imbricate, ovate-lanceolate to ovate-triangular, broadly keeled distally, 1.2–1.7(–2) mm, 1-stratose with 2-stratose patches or evenly 2-stratose distally; margins recurved to near apex, smooth, usually 2-stratose, occasionally multistratose; apices acute or blunt; costa sub-percurrent or excurrent as a lightly denticulate, usually broad-based, and flexuose awn that often embraces a portion of the leaf apex, smooth; basal marginal cells quadrate or short-rectangular; distal laminal cells ovate or short-rectangular, 6–10 µm wide, sinuose, trigonous.  Sexual condition autoicous.  Capsule red- or orange-brown, short-cylindric, 0.8–1.1(–1.3) mm; exothecial cells mostly elongate, mixed with isodiametric and a few oblate cells, thin-walled, sometimes trigonous; stomata present; peristome patent to recurved, sometimes twisted, 270–440 µm, bright red or orange, densely papillose, strongly perforated with uneven margins.  Spores 8–12 µm, granulose or nearly smooth.</description>

  <discussion>Schistidium venetum is a distinctive, rather small species characterized by patchy or completely 2-stratose distal laminae, a lightly denticulate and usually broad-based awn that frequently embraces the upper portions of the lamina, and strongly perforated, uneven-sided peristome teeth.</discussion>
