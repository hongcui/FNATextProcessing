    <description>Stem leaves mucronate to short-awned. Capsule cleistocarpous, peristome rarely
        differentiated internally, operculum absent or occasionally weakly differentiated. Spores

    <discussion>Variety fosbergii has elliptical capsules that lack both a differentiated operculum
        and a peristome (except California: Ikenberry, CANM, which has a weakly differentiated
        operculum and rudimentary peristome teeth). This variety apparently has spores that are both
        tuberculate and papillose (also true in the type), occasionally nearly smooth. If the spores
        are unreduced (though there is no evidence they are), then hybridization would be
        implicated. R. M. Ros et al. (1994) have described from Spain a putative hybrid between
        Microbryum starckeanum and Tortula protobryoides (as Pottia bryoides), which is evidently
        much the same as the var. fosbergii.</discussion>
