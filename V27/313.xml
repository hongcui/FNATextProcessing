  <discussion>Grimmia plagiopodia has a widespread and continuous distribution on calcareous rock across the northern Great Plains, reaching as far east as Illinois.  It is rare in eastern North America, with a disjunct site in southern Ontario.  In the west it reaches into the mountains on limestone and basic sandstone deposits, but its continuous range does not extend west of a line from Utah to south-central British Columbia.  There is a disjunct location near Carson City, Nevada and Lake Tahoe, California.  In the Arctic it is known from a few scattered localities extending from northwestern Greenland and nearby Ellesmere Island to the North Slope of Alaska.  Compared to G. anodon, G. plagiopodia tends to occupy more prairie-like sites and is typically found at lower elevations.  Commonly fertile, it is recognized by its immersed, peristomate capsule on a sigmoid seta with fully-developed teeth that are perforated and split distally.  Grimmia americana is similar but has a short, straight to arcuate seta and a large annulus.  The other widespread species in the group, G. anodon, has an annulus and is gymnostomous.</discussion>
