  <discussion>Bucklandiella venusta is largely restricted to the Appalachian Mountains, but ranges from Newfoundland to South Carolina and the Great Lakes Basin, westwards to Lake Superior.  It has commonly been confused with B. affinis, B. heterosticha, B. sudetica, and B. microcarpa, and only recently has it been recognized as a distinct species.  It is best distinguished by a combination of both gametophyte and sporophyte characters, including ovate and entirely hyaline innermost perichaetial bracts, variously bistratose leaf margins in 1–3(–4) cells rows that are recurved nearly to the apex, muticous or piliferous leaf apices, slightly differentiated alar cells, and an undifferentiated basal marginal border.  Bucklandiella venusta is most likely to be mistaken for B. affinis, with which it shares the same form of the innermost perichaetial leaves, but the latter has predominantly 1-stratose leaf margins with only occasional 1-seriate 2-stratose spots that are not wavy or lumpy.  Also, the costa in B. affinis is stronger, mostly 4-stratose basally with 5–7 enlarged adaxial cells, and the awn is usually longer, more slender, often narrow and capillaceous distally and flattened basally.  Bucklandia heterosticha is unknown in the range of B. venusta but it has much broader and flatter, broadly canaliculate costa, a long hyaline awn, and predominantly 1-stratose leaf margins.  Superficially, B. venusta is similar to B. sudetica, however they are only distantly related.  They differ fundamentally in the form of the innermost perichaetial leaves, the latter having them only a bit different from the vegetative leaves.  In addition, the plants of B. sudetica are less branched and have more weakly recurved leaf margins, to 1/2–3/4 the leaf length usually only on one side, and more or less smooth and even at the sides in the distal half.  The latter feature would seem difficult to evaluate, but the leaf margins are so wavy to lumpy on the sides that with experience, this feature can effectively be used to separate the two species.  Bucklandiella venusta should not be mistaken for B. microcarpa, the long basal marginal border of 8–15 pellucid, straight-walled cells in the latter being immediately diagnostic.  Moreover, the leaf margins in B. microcarpa are 1-stratose, with only occasional 2-stratose spots in the distal portion and the costa has 3–4 much larger adaxial cells as visible in transverse-section.</discussion>
