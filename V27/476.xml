  <discussion>Fissidens ventricosus occurs along the Pacific Coast of North America and at a disjunct site in northern Idaho (see map in R. R. Ireland and W. B. Schofield 1967).  It is distinguished by its aquatic habitat, strongly limbate leaves, variably 2-stratose laminal cells, short, thick, geniculate seta, and emergent capsule.  Plants usually become black and covered with diatoms.  The species might be confused with F. rigidulus Hooker f. &amp; Wilson, but the latter, found in wet sites in the Americas from Chile north to Mexico but not known in the United States, has much smaller laminal cells and a long seta characteristic of terrestrial species.  The calyptra of F. ventricosus is cucullate according to Ireland and Schofield.</discussion>
