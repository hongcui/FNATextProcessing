  <discussion>The imbricate, concave, and long-awned leaves (the concentration of awns at growing tips of the branches resemble brushes), with plane or erect margins and 2-stratose distal laminae, along with the ease by which patches fragment into individual stems, make Schistidium heterophyllum, in most cases, an easily recognized species, even though it is usually sterile.  Schistidium tenerum is similar in most of these characters, but is much smaller and usually forms more compact cushions.  Also, its distal laminae are unevenly 2-stratose, its leaf margins are recurved, and its awns are often strongly flexuose when dry.  Where their ranges overlap in arid regions of western North America, S. heterophyllum can be easily mistaken for the macroscopically similar Grimmia laevigata.  Both species are usually sterile, are of the same coloration and size, and have similar leaf characteristics.  These taxa can be separated by a number of characters: the costa is pronounced on the abaxial leaf surface of S. heterophyllum and forms a distinct ridge, whereas the costa of G. laevigata is flat or only weakly raised above the laminal surface, its leaves are usually broader and not as imbricate when dry, its distal leaf cells are wider (7–9) than those of S. heterophyllum (5–6), and its leaves usually narrow considerably more to the stem base than do those of S. heterophyllum.</discussion>
