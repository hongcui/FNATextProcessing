  <discussion>Atrichum selwynii is a common species largely restricted to western North America.  It is easily recognized by the rosulate habit, the characteristic leaf border, with teeth irregular and crowded near the leaf apices, large, thin-walled leaf cells (to 48 µm wide), and numerous sporophytes per perichaetium.  E. Nyholm (1971) treated A. altecristatum as a variety of A. selwynii, but A. altecristatum is monoicous and exclusively eastern.  T. C. Frye (1937) combined A. selwynii and A. altecristatum, as A. undulatum var. selwynii (Austin) Frye.  The easternmost outpost of A. selwynii is in the Black Hills of South Dakota, in company with other western mosses.  Plants from the Pacific Coast Ranges with low and inconspicuous lamellae, 2–5 cells high, were referred by Frye (1910) to A. undulatum, part of his overly broad concept of this species, but were recognized by W. C. Steere et al. (1954) as clearly not that species.  Plants of A. selwynii from Rocky populations typically have lamellae 8–12 cells high and higher.</discussion>
