  <discussion>Weissia occidentalis is known only from the type collection (Millard County, House Mountains, Swasey Gulch, 1800 m, Flowers 2339, COLO).  It has the leaves typical of W. ligulifolia, these being long-elliptical and sharply incurved distally.  Weissia inoperculata is superficially similar in its cleistocarpic capsule and elongate seta, but differs by the longer seta and leaves similar to those of Trichostomum brachydontium—stoutly mucronate, broadly elliptical and nearly plane throughout.</discussion>
