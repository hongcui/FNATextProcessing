  <description>Plants moderate-sized, soft and lax when wet, stiff when dry, typically very
        compact, capitulum flat and usually large; pale whitish, yellowish or purplish, occasionally
        a deep purple-red; without metallic sheen when dry. Stems pale green to straw-colored;
        superficial cortical cells aporose. Stem leaves quite variable in shape, elongate-lingulate
        to ovate, broadest above the middle, 1.9–2.5 mm, slightly concave, straight; apex broad and
        toothed; hyaline cells narrowly rhomboid, 0–1-septate, distal portion fibrillose, convex
        surface with membrane pleats, concave surface with 1(2–3) oblong membrane gaps. Branches
        rarely 5-ranked. Branch fascicles with 2 spreading and 1–2 pendent branches. Branch leaves
        ovate, 1.6–2.2 mm, concave, straight; apex stiffly involute and broadly truncate with up to
        8 teeth, border denticulate due to cell wall resorption and projecting cell walls; hyaline
        cells strongly bulging on convex surface and nearly plane on the concave surface, convex
        surface with narrowly elliptic pores along commissures grading from smaller pores near the
        apex to large rounded pores at base, concave surface with large round pores in proximal
        regions of leaf. Sexual condition monoicous. Spores 27–33 µm, finely papillose on both
        surfaces with distinct bifurcated Y-mark sculpture on distal surface; proximal laesura less
        than 0.5 spore radius.</description>

  <habitat>Weakly minerotrophic and hygrophytic, poor fens and sand dunes, forming tight cushions
        among grasses and sedges in savannas, pine barrens, swamps, pond margins, and ditches where
        periodic dessication is common;</habitat>

  <discussion>The sporophytes of Sphagnum molle are common. This species is usually easily
        distinguished from other red species of sect. Acutifolia by its relatively large, straight,
        loosely spreading and unranked branch leaves. Sphagnum tenerum, the other red species of
        sect. Acutifolia to which it is most similar, has branch leaves that are quite imbricate.
        Microscopically, the denticulate-margined branch leaves are unmistakeable.</discussion>
