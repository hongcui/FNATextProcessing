Leaves erect-spreading and flexuose-crisped when dry, 2.5–4 mm, gradually narrowed from an ovate base to a long, slender, subtubulose subula; margins distinctly recurved below, erect or incurved above, serrulate at or near the slender apex; costa percurrent, filling most of the subula; distal cells subquadrate, 1–2:1 (ca. 17 × 10 µm), 2-stratose at the margins.  Sexual condition dioicous.  Seta red, 5–8 mm.  Capsule inclined to horizontal, 0.8 mm, obovoid-oblong, curved, not strumose, smooth; annulus none; operculum-conic; peristome teeth ca. 425 µm, divided 1/2 length distally.  Spores 15–17 µm, smooth.</description><phenology>Capsules mature fall and winter.</phenology><habitat>  Wet, silty soil of roadside ditch banks and soil of cliff crevices;</habitat><elevation> low to medium elevations;</elevation><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wash.</us_distribution><discussion>Distinctive features of Dicranella pacifica include slender, flexuose-crisped, subtubulose leaves with margins recurved below but 2-stratose and incurved above, high-conic opercula, and annulus absent.</discussion></treatment>
