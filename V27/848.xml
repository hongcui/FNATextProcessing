Sexual condition autoicous.  Sporophytes exerted.  Seta 0.9–1.1 cm.  Capsule stegocarpic, not systylius, cylindric, erect and nearly straight, urn 2–2.7 mm; peristome 1000–1400 µm, teeth of 32 filaments, twisted once, basal membrane ca. 200 µm; operculum 1.1–1.5 mm.  Spores 11–14 µm, spheric, essentially smooth.</description><phenology>Capsules mature spring.</phenology><habitat>  Arid soil, rock;</habitat><elevation> low elevations (0–50 m);</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico (Baja California).</global_distribution><discussion>Tortula californica has now been reported from several counties in southern California (D.
