  <discussion>Genus 1, species 1:</discussion>
  <discussion>The Oedipodiaceae has been placed in the Funariales and, more commonly, in the Splachnales.  Sometimes Oedipodium has been placed in the Splachnaceae because of the remarkably differentiated neck of the capsule that is somewhat similar to the expanded hypophysis of that family.  In addition to the distinctive capsule neck, Oedipodiaceae is further characterized by the branched-thallose protonema bearing discoid brood bodies, and also by rosettes of erect-spreading leaves with stalked, discoid brood bodies often mingled with sex organs; leaves broadly rounded above a very narrow base, and leaf cells with tiny corner thickenings.  The brood bodies of Oedipodium are somewhat like those of Alophosia, of the Polytrichaceae.  However, the nature of the protonema in Oedipodium, and the production of brood bodies on the protonema and also in rosettes that are somewhat like the gemma cups of Tetraphis, suggest a closer relationship of Oedipodiaceae to the Tetraphidaceae.</discussion>
