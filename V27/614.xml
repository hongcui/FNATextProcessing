  <discussion>Species 12 (1 in the flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>Nine species of Symblepharis occur in southeastern Asia, two in the Neotropics, and one in tropical Africa.  The genus is recognized by wide-spreading leaf tips that are crisped when dry, the linear-lanceolate lamina abruptly distinct from a flaring obovate-sheathing base, and, when they do occur, setae clustered.  The distinctive striate proximal and papillose distal portions of the peristome teeth, and the grouping of the teeth into eight tooth-pairs are also characteristic.  The organization of the peristome is somewhat more complex than descriptions usually indicate, the eight groups of paired teeth being separated by “a space equivalent to one tooth between each pair” (H. C. Gangulee 1969+, fasc. 2).  The gametophyte of the genus is nearly identical with that of the common and widespread Oncophorus wahlenbergii.  Since both species display bistratose leaf margins, this is not a good character to differentiate them (see discussion below).  In S. vaginata the capsule is erect, long-cylindric, symmetric, and tapering gradually to the seta, and is essentially smooth wet or dry.  The capsule of O. wahlenbergii is inclined to horizontal, short-ovoid, asymmetric, and with a goiterlike swelling at the base (as is the case for all species of Oncophorus), and is generally distinctly furrowed when dry.</discussion>
