A. Worley and Z. Iwatsuki (1970) recorded var. orthophyllum from Alaska.  It is an extremely weak Arctic variety that differs from var. majus in only a few minor characters.  The plants immediately appear different because of the erect-patent, short leaves instead of the long, falcate-secund leaves of var. majus.  More collections are needed from many Arctic localities to better understand var. orthophyllum, which may only be an environmental form.</discussion></treatment>
