  <discussion>Dicranum rhabdocarpum is an easily recognized species that occurs in the flora area only in the Rocky Mountains and the mountains of Arizona.  It is the only species in the section Dicranum that has erect, straight to weakly arcuate capsules.  Other important distinguishing features are the ovate-lanceolate, straight, obtusely acute, 1-stratose leaves with alar cells 1- or 2-stratose in part and the subpercurrent to percurrent costae that are smooth or weakly toothed on the abaxial surface near the leaf apex.  Dicranum rhabdocarpum has been placed in the segregate genus Orthodicranum by J. M. Holzinger (1925b) and other bryologists mainly because of its straight and erect capsules.  However, it differs from taxa commonly placed in that genus, i.e., D. flagellare, D. fulvum, D. montanum, D. strictum, and D. viride, by the elongate, pitted cells and the alar cells that are sometimes 2-stratose.</discussion>
