  <discussion>Bucklandiella obesa ranges from Vancouver Island to central California at higher elevations.  The species is well-defined and distinct from all other congeners by the combination of several structural characters, including strongly modified, hyaline innermost perichaetial leaves, large leaves with a stiff awn, leaf margins that are broadly revolute to recurved to the apex and 2-stratose distally in 2(–3) rows of cells, not differentiated alar cells and basal marginal border, and robust and broad costa, distinctly convex abaxially with 5–9 adaxial cells.  It is strikingly more robust than B. heterosticha and B. affinis, the other two species of sect. Laevifoliae that have predominantly 1-stratose and even leaf margins in the distal portion and longer, flexuose, and less spinulose awns.  Bucklandiella venusta is easily distinct in its shorter and narrower leaves and much narrower costa as well as in being a much smaller plant.  Bucklandiella obesa has often been confused with Codriophorus varius, with which it shares similar robustness and long-cylindrical capsules.  However, the latter is readily distinct in its laminal cells that are papillose in a manner characteristic of that genus, much longer peristome teeth, consistently 1-stratose leaf margin, and presence of the pellucid basal marginal border.</discussion>
