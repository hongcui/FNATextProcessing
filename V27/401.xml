  <discussion>Niphotrichum elongatum has only recently been formally described as a distinct species.  Although it was distinguished at that level by several bryologists of the early eighteenth century, it subsequently fell into oblivion and was merged with N. canescens.  It is very distinct, though closely related to N. ericoides.  In contrast to the latter, it is a more southern taxon, and in North America does not extend to the Arctic, reaching its northernmost locality on Gilbert Island in southeastern Alaska.  Apart from a few collections from the southernmost tip of Greenland, it has been found only once at lat. 70ยบ N in East Greenland.  It grows in habitats similar to those of N. ericoides, with which it often occurs in mixed stands, but the latter generally favours drier, warmer, and more exposed microhabitats than the former.</discussion>
