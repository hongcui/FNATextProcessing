  <discussion>Archidium alternifolium is widely distributed in the southeastern region of the United States.  It is closely related to A. tenerrimum, which differs by much shorter and wider lamina cells and smooth margins of perichaetial leaves.  The filiform rhizoidal gemmae are difficult to find, as most collections of the species have abundant uniseriate algae growing among the rhizoids.  Recently, material referred to A. alternifolium was collected in Santa Cruz County, California.  The collection is somewhat different than typical material, however, as it has strongly subulate perichaetial leaves and much shorter lamina cells, with those in mid-leaf being somewhat irregular in shape and size.  Only a few plants were found, and more material is needed to determine their status.  However, collections identified as A. donnellii and A. hallii have recently been reported from the Pacific coast of Baja California, so the presence of A. alternifolium is not completely unexpected.</discussion>
