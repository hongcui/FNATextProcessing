  <discussion>Dicranum leioneuron is apparently closely related to D. bonjeanii.  It is best distinguished by the subulate leaves with twisted apices when dry, the usual occurrence of julaceous stem portions with broad, short, concave, and somewhat obtuse leaves in contrast to the longer, narrower, subulate, and acute leaves of the other stem portions.  Its occurrence only in hummocks in peatlands also is a clue to its identity.  The plants rarely produce sporophytes but in any event they cannot be distinguished from those of the other species in section Dicranum.  The species probably occurs in peatlands in northeastern United States and it should be looked for in that region.</discussion>
