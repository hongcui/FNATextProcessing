        becoming shorter or oblate towards the margins; basal cells elongate to linear, 25–95 × 8–12
        µm, with strongly incrassate and porose walls; alar cells not or weakly differentiated;
        basal marginal cells quadrate to short-rectangular, rarely long-rectangular, esinuose or
        very seldom sinuose, hyaline or very rarely chlorophyllose, forming pellucid, 1(–2)-seriate
        border of (5–)10–20(–25) cells, very occasionally not transparent. Innermost perichaetial
        leaves (4–6), markedly modified, ovate, acuminate, epilose or very seldom piliferous,
        hyaline to yellowish hyaline in the proximal half, chlorophyllose in the distal half with
        strongly incrassate cell walls. Seta dark red to reddish brown, (2.5–)4.5–8 mm. Capsule
        obloid-cylindric to elongate-ovoid, (1.2–)1.5–2 × 0.3–0.6 mm, brown, dull to weakly
        lustrous; peristome teeth yellow-reddish, 310–350 µm, papillose, irregularly divided nearly
        to the base into 2 prongs, sometimes only with elongate perforations, without or with a low
        basal membrane, 10–15 µm high. Operculum conical-rostrate, to 1 mm, with a straight or
        slanted beak. Spores (10–)12–14(–16) µm.</description>

  <discussion>Bucklandiella microcarpa is a temperate moss, occasionally penetrating into the
        Arctic. It has a bicentric distribution in North America, being most common and widespread
        in the eastern part of the continent and less frequent in the west, where it occurs mostly
        in the Rocky Mountains from the Yukon to Montana. It is principally a Euro-American species,
        with some scattered records in Siberia. In Europe it shows distinct continental tendencies
        and is absent from the oceanic western part, including the British Isles.</discussion>
  <discussion>Bucklandiella microcarpa is an unmistakable species that is at once distinct from
        other North American congeners by its long, pellucid basal marginal border of esinuose cells
        and markedly modified innermost perichaetial leaves, with chlorophyllose distal cells having
        strongly incrassate walls and basal laminal cells that are esinuose and have porose and
        prominently thickened lateral walls. Also, it is worth noting that the laminal cells are
        usually pseudopapillose in B. microcarpa and the pseudopapillosity is especially pronounced
        in the western North American populations.</discussion>
  <discussion>Bucklandiella microcarpa resembles B. affinis, B. heterosticha, B. sudetica, and B.
        venusta in leaf shape and in having pilose leaves. The first two species are also similar in
        having typically 1-stratose leaf margins. In addition to their less well developed or absent
        basal marginal border, these species differ from B. microcarpa in having broader costae:
        80–100 µm versus 60–80 µm in the proximal portion. Bucklandiella sudetica and B. venusta
        also differ from B. microcarpa in having regularly 2-stratose leaf margins. In Alaska, B.
        microcarpa is likely to be mistaken with Dryptodon jacuticus (= Grimmia leibergii), which
        has long-pilose leaves and similar costal anatomy, with 3–4 much enlarged adaxial cells.
        However, D. jacuticus has 2-stratose leaf margins and subquadrate to short-rectangular
        laminal cells in the distal part, straight or only slightly flexuose hair-points, and
        undifferentiated basal marginal cells.</discussion>
