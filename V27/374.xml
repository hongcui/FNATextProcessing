    <description>Plants small, medium-sized to large, fairly slender to coarse, sometimes hoary.
        Stems prostrate, curved-ascending to erect, 1–15 cm, often copiously pinnately or
        intricately branched. Leaves lanceolate, straight to falcate, piliferous or muticous;
        hair-point often long, strongly flexuose; margins usually recurved on both sides to 1/2–3/4
        of the leaf length, rarely to the apex, 1–2-stratose; costa 2–3-stratose in the proximal
        part; laminal cells long-rectangular in the distal half, esinuose, porose and with strongly
        incrassate walls near the base; basal marginal border present, composed of transparent
        cells. Innermost perichaetial leaves strongly differentiated, hyaline proximally,
        chlorophyllose distally with areolation of cells with strongly incrassate walls, epilose or
        rarely piliferous.</description>

    <discussion>Section Marginatae is a sharply delimited taxon characterized primarily by strongly
        modified innermost perichaetial leaves that have the areolation in the distal half composed
        of cells with strongly incrassate walls. Additionally, the basal cells of vegetatvie leaves
        are esinuose with markedly incrassate lateral walls, the distal cells tend to be elongate,
        and the basal marginal border is present and is composed of pellucid, esinuose
        cells.</discussion>

            <statement>Leaves often secund, not spirally arranged; basal marginal border composed of

                mostly present, 0.3–1.1 mm, capillaceous, flexuose, sharply denticulate</statement>
