  <discussion>Species 1:</discussion>
  <discussion>Crumia is a robust moss similar to Scopelophila in the often black or deep brown coloration of the plants, the lack of either a sclerodermis or a hyalodermis in the stem, the spathulate leaf shape and single costal stereid band, but differs in the presence of a stem central strand (though small or occasionally absent), a more strongly differentiated, intramarginal leaf border, and presence of a peristome (though rarely fruiting).  Hennediella has bordered leaves but is red in KOH, not reddish orange, and has plane leaf margins with marginal cells not larger than the medial as seen in section.  A second species, Crumia deciduidentata, was referred to Tortula by R. H. Zander (1993) on the basis of differences in the peristome, the awned perichaetial leaves, strong stem central strand, and presence of a hydroid strand in the costa.</discussion>
