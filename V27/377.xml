  <description>Plants medium-sized to fairly large, rather slender, loosely caespitose or forming
        extensive patches, dull green to yellowish or blackish in the upper part, brownish or
        blackish brown proximally, sometimes hoary. Stems 5–7 cm, erect to decumbent, sparsely or
        profusely subpinnately branched, rarely quite unbranched. Leaves loosely appressed, straight
        or secund when dry, erect-spreading to spreading when moist, lanceolate, channeled along the
        costa, (1.7–)2.3–3.2(–4) (with a hair-point) × 0.5–0.8 mm; margins entire, smooth or
        somewhat wavy in the distal half, recurved to revolute on both sides to the apex, 1-stratose
        distally or with 2-stratose patches, seldom predominantly 2-stratose near the apex in 1 cell
        row; epilose or piliferous, awns erect-flexuous, more yellowish than whitish, flattened,
        (0.1–)0.5–1.1 mm, low-denticulate at the margins and occasionally spinulose at the abaxial
        side, usually not or slightly decurrent; costa percurrent or shortly excurrent into the awn,
        prominently convex abaxially, 80–100(–110) µm wide at the base, 60–70 µm wide distally,
        3–4-stratose with 5–7 adaxial cells in the proximal portion, 3-stratose in the middle with
        3–4 adaxial cells and 2–3-stratose distally with 2–3 cells on the adaxial side; laminal
        cells 1-stratose, not or slightly bulging on both adaxial and abaxial sides; basal laminal
        cells elongate, 15–35 × 7–10 µm, with thick and sinuose-nodulose walls; alar cells usually
        slightly differentiated, yellowish, sometimes forming a small, auriculate group of wider
        cells; supra-alar cells undifferentiated, not forming a marginal border; upper and medial
        laminal cells rectangular to isodiametric, 10–25 × 7–10 µm. Inner perichaetial leaves ovate,
        hyaline, epilose. Seta brown, 4–10 mm. Capsule brown, somewhat lustrous, shortly cylindric,
        rarely obloid or ovoid, 1.5–3.2 × 0.6–0.8 mm; operculum long-rostrate, to 1.5 mm; peristome
        teeth 200–400 µm, reddish brown, papillose, mostly discontinuously divided into 2 prongs by
        median perforations, arising from a low basal membrane, to 30 µm high. Spores 12–20
        µm.</description>

  <discussion>Bucklandiella affinis is bicentrically distributed in North America with the main
        centre of its occurrence in the western part of the continent. There it is widely
        distributed in coastal areas from the Aleutian Islands to northern California and in the
        Rocky Mountains, southwards to Montana, Idaho, and Colorado. In eastern North America the
        species is widely distributed but scattered in the Great Lakes Basin, Newfoundland, Nova
        Scotia, and Maine. It is a dull blackish green moss with strongly differentiated, hyaline
        innermost perichaetial bracts, broad and strongly convex abaxially costae, not or weakly
        differentiated alar cells, and leaf margins that are recurved to revolute on both sides to
        the apex and predominantly 1-stratose in the distal portion. The species is closely related
        to B. heterosticha and the differences between them are discussed under the latter. It is
        unlikely to be mistaken with other species of the B. heterosticha complex and is easily
        distinguished from B. sudetica and B. venusta, which have mostly 2-stratose leaf margins in
        the distal part. Bucklandiella microcarpa shares with B. affinis 1-stratose leaf margins,
        but is readily recognized by having a prominent, pellucid basal marginal border of
        thin-walled and not sinuose cells.</discussion>
