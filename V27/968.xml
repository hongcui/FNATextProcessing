  <description>Plants caespitose, dark green to brownish, to 1 cm.  Leaves monomorphic, 2–3 mm, crispate-contorted when dry; distal lamina reflexed at shoulders, usually folded when wet, broadly linear-acuminate, apex obtuse; margins bordered all around with elongate hyaline cells, mostly toothed only at apex but rarely with denticulations at shoulders; medial cells obscure because of papillosity, 7.5–8.5 µm, with stout, multifid papillae ad- and abaxially; cancellinae rounded distally.  Gemmae clavate-fusiform, smooth, sparse, on adaxial apex of leaf.</description>

  <discussion>Syrrhopodon gaudichaudii is widespread and often abundant elsewhere in its range but is known in the flora area only from a few collections from Highlands Hammock, Highlands County.  It is similar in a general way to S. prolifer but differs in its leaves contorted-crispate when dry and folded when moist.  The leaves of S. prolifer are usually flexuous or straight when dry and lie flat on the microscope slide when wet.</discussion>
