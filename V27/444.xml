  <discussion>Seligeria diversifolia occurs on stones in arctic Alaska, then south along the western mountains into the Yukon, and is found on cliff faces from a few stations in eastern North America.  It is slender and stiff with differentiated perichaetial leaves, and a straight to slightly curved seta when moist, while the similar S. campylopoda has curved-twisted leaves, no differentiated perichaetial leaves, and a markedly curved seta when moist.</discussion>
