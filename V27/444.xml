    <discussion>Known only from the type locality in the Queen Charlotte Islands, Seligeria careyana
        is characterized by its emergent, ovate capsules, which tend to become turbinate with a
        flaring mouth when old and dry. The leaves are linear, with an extremely long, slender
        subula formed almost entirely of the costa. The leaves, except for the interior perichaetial
        ones, rarely flare outward to any extent at the base.</discussion>
