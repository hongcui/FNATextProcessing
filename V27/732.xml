  <discussion>Variety densa is apparently associated with older, stable habitats, rather than
        colonizing relatively more recent ones, as does var. inclinata. The stems are reddish
        orange, the leaves are densely foliose, and in cross section they have thickened superficial
        cell walls on both sides of the leaf section, forming pedestals on which the papillae are
        developed. Most of the leaves are acuminate, rather than cucullate, perhaps because the
        stems are richly perichaetiate. As the two reports of Tortella inclinata from arctic North
        America are var. densa, var. inclinata is considered here to be absent from that region. The
        most striking characteristic of western North American specimens from rocky substrates is
        their tall, densely foliose, numerously branched stems in regimented tufts, unlike var.
        inclinata, with stems usually smaller and indistinct, little branched, and leaves more
        chaotically twisted around the stem and half buried in the debris. The western specimens
        have darker (fuscous to black proximally) or more highly colored (orange) aspect, stiffer
        leaves, many or most narrowly acute yet still inrolled such that a subcucullate aspect to
        the leaf apex could be identified, a relatively orderly ropelike disposition of the leaves
        on dry stems, and peculiar distinctly thickened superficial cell walls.</discussion>
