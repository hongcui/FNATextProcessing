  <description>Plants small to large, in loose or compact tufts or forming extensive paches or
        mats, green, brown, yellowish, olive green, less often blackish brown or occasionally
        jet-black. Stems erect, decumbent or creeping, much dichotomously to irregularly, sometimes
        (sub-)pinnately branched, rarely almost simple and unbranched. Leaves lanceolate, oblong- or
        ovate-lanceolate, concave proximally, canaliculate to carinate distally; margins 1-stratose
        to variously multistratose, variously recurved to revolute on one or both sides, entire;
        apices acute or occasionally narrowly obtuse, entire or very seldom crenulate,
        long-piliferous to short-hyaline-tipped or sometimes epilose, if present, hyaline to
        yellowish hyaline, never papillose; costa single, percurrent, semi-terete in the distal and
        median parts, reniform to strongly flattened in the proximal portion, 2-to multistratose,
        with 2 to many enlarged, adaxial epidermal cells and small, substereid or stereid central
        and abaxial cells; laminal cells 1-stratose throughout or variously multistratose in the
        distal half, with moderately to strongly incrassate, sinuose to nodulose lateral walls,
        smooth or often pseudopapillose; basal laminal cells elongate, long-rectangular to linear;
        distal laminal cells quadrate, rounded-quadrate, oblate to rectangular. Inner perichaetial
        leaves not or strongly modified, often entirely hyaline to yellowish hyaline. Seta 1–3 per
        perichaetium, erect, twisted clockwise distally, smooth. Capsule brown, castaneous or
        blackish brown, straight, symmetric, ovoid, ellipsoid, obloid to narrowly cylindric,
        narrowed at the mouth, without or with an indistinct neck; exothecial cells variable in size
        and shape, subquadrate to oblong, with thin to thick, straight or flexuose walls; annulus
        compound, abruptly or tardily deciduous, 2–4-seriate; operculum straight or slanted,
        conic-rostrate or long-rostellate; peristome teeth lanceolate to triangular, reddish brown
        or brown, cleft into 2–3 filiform, terete prongs in the distal half, occasionally 2-fid
        nearly to the base. Calyptra 4–5-lobed at the base, naked. Spores spheric, finely granular
        to coarsely papillose.</description>

  <discussion>Bucklandiella is the largest and taxonomically most difficult segregate of a broadly
        conceived Racomitrium. It is a clearly defined and easily recognized taxon that, in contrast
        to the other three segregates of Racomitrium, comprises taxa with smooth laminal cells.
        There may be pseudopapillae, due to numerous longitudinal cuticular ridges that make the
        leaf surface rugged and appear papillose in transverse-section. The smooth laminal cells are
        coupled with relatively short, lanceolate or triangular peristome teeth, which are
        irregularly divided in the distal half into 2–3 or occasionally 4 branches, which however,
        are sometimes only irregularly perforated along the median line. In some cases the teeth
        remain undivided. Additionally, the following combination of characters is typical of this
        genus: narrowly lanceolate to ovate-triangular leaves; unbranched, percurrent costa; awns,
        if present, smooth, denticulate, or spinulose but never papillose; leaf margins
        1–2(–4)-stratose in one to several cell rows; and seta always smooth, twisted to the right
        when dry.</discussion>
