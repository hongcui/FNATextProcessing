Stems 2–11 cm, densely tomentose below with reddish brown rhizoids, inter-ruptedly foliate, the leaves crowded in some parts forming swollen, globose regions.  Leaves erect-spreading, arched and loosely imbricate with contorted apices when dry, ± undulate to rugose, (2.5–)5–6.5(–9) × 1–1.7 mm, concave below, tubulose above, acute, ovate at base, widest point at or somewhat below middle; margins serrulate to serrate in distal half, plane to involute; laminae 1-stratose or with 2-stratose regions near costa and on margins; costa percurrent to shortly excurrent, 1/8–1/4 the width of the leaves at base, serrulate or toothed above on abaxial surface, abaxial ridges absent, with a row of guide cells, two stereid bands extending to apex, adaxial epidermal layer of cells not differentiated, the abaxial layer differentiated; cell walls between lamina cells weakly to strongly bulging; leaf cells strongly papillose above on abaxial surface, sometimes a few papillae on adaxial surface; alar cells 2-stratose, distinctly differentiated, not extending to costa; proximal laminal cells elongate, pitted, (30–)49–68(–101) × (5–)10–11(–15) µm, abruptly shorter in distal half of leaf; distal laminal cells short, not or indistinctly pitted, cell walls irregularly thickened, (7–)11–12(–23) × (5–)7–13(–20) µm.  Sexual condition pseudomonoicous; dwarf males on rhizoids of female plants; interior perichaetial leaves abruptly short-acuminate, convolute-sheathing.  Seta 1–3 cm, solitary, reddish yellow or brown.  Capsule 1.5–2.5 mm, arcuate, inclined to horizontal, contracted below mouth and furrowed when dry, yellowish brown to brown; operculum 1.5–2.5 mm.  Spores 16–24 µm.</description><phenology>Capsules mature spring.</phenology><habitat>  Sandy soil, decayed logs, acidic rock, humus over exposed bluffs or outcrops, in pine woods, sometimes bogs;</habitat><elevation> 0–1400 m;</elevation><ca_distribution> Nfld. and Labr.

It is likely to be confused only with 11. D. condensatum (see discussion thereunder).</discussion></treatment>
