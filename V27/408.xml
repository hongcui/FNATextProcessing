  <discussion>Codriophorus aduncoides is a montane, hydrophilous, acidophilous moss that can tolerate periodic desiccation.  It is restricted to the Appalachian Mountains, ranging from western Maine to Tennessee and North Carolina.  Codriophorus aduncoides has only recently been recognized as a species, being segregated from the common and protean C. acicularis.  The two species share similar leaf shape and areolation as well as identical ecological predilections, but C. aduncoides is well-defined and easy to distinguish by the structure of the costa.  It is generally shorter and vanishes in mid leaf or extends at most to three quarters of the way up the leaf.  It is distinctly spurred on both sides in the distal portion and is mostly forked at the apex.  Additionally, the leaves are usually falcate-secund and the leaf apex is often tubular to subcucullate owing to the inflexed margins.</discussion>
