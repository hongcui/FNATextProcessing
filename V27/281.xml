  <discussion>Schistidium agassizii is sometimes confused with S. rivulare, another dark species found along watercourses.  It differs in having linear-lanceolate, almost straight-sided, and distally nearly flat leaves, with plane or weakly recurved margins.  The leaves of S. rivulare are often lighter in color, ovate-lanceolate to ovate-triangular, and always distally keeled with recurved margins.  Also, S. rivulare usually forms much larger patches than does S. agassizii.  New leaves of S. agassizii are often yellow-green or brownish, somewhat concave-keeled distally, and are somewhat julaceous, forming finger-like projections at the tips of stems.  Schistidium subjulaceum is another similar species that grows along watercourses but is distinguished from S. agassizii by the same vegetative characters that separate the latter from S. rivulare, as well as by its smaller, often lighter colored, and short-cylindrical or ovoid capsules.</discussion>
