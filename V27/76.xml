  <description>Plants small to moderate-sized, unbranched or sparsely branched; green, golden
        brown to brown, capitulum small with a large and conspicuous terminal bud. Stems green to
        brown; superficial cortex of 2–3 layers of enlarged, thin-walled cells. Stem leaves broadly
        ovate, 1.2–2.2 mm; straight; apex rounded; hyaline cells non-septate, convex surface with
        numerous small pores (less than or equal to 1/6 cell diameter) forming a continuous row
        along the commissures, concave surface aporose or with a few scattered pores along the
        commissures and cell ends. Branches short and blunt, sometimes lacking completely and plants
        simplex. Branch fascicles of 1–3 branches, 1–2 of these spreading, branches usually not
        numerous. Branch leaves broadly ovate, 1.4–2.5(–3) mm; straight; apex rounded; hyaline cells
        as in stem leaf. Sexual condition dioicous. Capsule exserted, with few pseudostomata. Spores
        23–35 µm; papillose on both surfaces, with indistinct Y-mark sculpture on distal surface;
        proximal laesura 0.5 spore radius or less.</description>

  <discussion>Sporophytes are uncommon in Sphagnum platyphyllum, which can be quite variable in
        size and the development of branch fascicles, with some forms even being simplex while other
        forms may have up to three branches per fascicle. The species can usually be recognized by
        the large stem leaves that are spreading and easily visible because of the scarcity of
        hanging branches. It should also be noted that in this species and S. contortum the
        2–3-layered stem cortex is not an entirely consistent trait, as plants quite typical in all
        other respects are occasionally found with the cortex only 1-layered, at least in
        part.</discussion>
