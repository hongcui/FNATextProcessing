  <description>Plants medium-sized, tufted or cespitose, glossy, dark green.  Stems erect or repent, to 1.5 cm.  Leaves crispate when dry, broadly acute to acuminate, 3–4 mm; margins coarsely serrate distally, erect or irregularly recurved proximally; apex plane or with erect margins but not cucullate.  Specialized asexual reproduction absent.  Seta 1(–4) per perichaetium, 3–4 mm.  Capsule cylindric, 2–2.4 mm, smooth to slightly or prominently wrinkled or ribbed when dry; peristome teeth divided into filiform segments, densely papillose.  Calyptra lobes less than 1/2 length of calyptra.</description>

  <global_distribution>prominently serrate leaf margins</global_distribution>
  <global_distribution>and plane leaf tips make it easy to recognize.  It is somewhat similar to P. gardneri but plants of the latter are much larger</global_distribution>
  <global_distribution>the two species do not co-occur.  This moss has been collected repeatedly in Texas</global_distribution>
  <global_distribution>mostly in Culberson Co.</global_distribution>
  <global_distribution>in the Guadalupe Mountains</global_distribution>
  <global_distribution>especially in McKittrick.  It has also been found in central and southern Louisiana</global_distribution>
  <global_distribution>at one site in South Carolina</global_distribution>

  <global_distribution>and eastern Texas were taken from man-made calcareous substrates (concrete)</global_distribution>
