  <discussion>Barbula unguiculata is common in eastern North America and Europe, and elsewhere in
        the North and South Temperate zones, but rare in the tropics and the Arctic, with, for
        instance, only two known sites in Mexico and a single one north of the Arctic tree line. The
        leaves are often blackened. Forms with strongly mucronate leaf apices have been referred to
        var. apiculata though modern authorities generally treat this as a form. Barbula indica is
        often confused with this species, but differs immediately in the leaves conduplicate but not
        contorted when dry, with plane or weakly recurved margins, and prorate abaxial surface of
        the costa. Barbula convoluta is similar but has plane margins, costa not excurrent as a
        mucro and seta yellow rather than reddish brown.</discussion>
