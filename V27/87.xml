  <discussion>Sphagnum bergianum forms dense hummocks in medium to rich fen habitats and is associated with such species as Sphagnum warnstorfii, S. subfulvum, S. subsecundum, S. platyphyllum and S. fuscum.</discussion>
  <discussion>Sphagnum bergianum is quite distinct in the field from its very dark brown color tinged with a deep red as well as its 5-ranked branch leaves.  Sphagnum subnitens is colored a light brown and red combination, and has unranked branch leaves.  Sphagnum subfulvum has a golden brown color that can be tinged with purple but also has unranked branch leaves.  Sphagnum flavicomans is a similar-sized brown species of sect. Acutifolia that overlaps S. bergianum in Newfoundland but it is golden brown, lacks the red tinge and has a longer and narrower branch and stem leaves.</discussion>
