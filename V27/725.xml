      <description type="morphology">Plants red-green, appearing black proximally, densely foliose with a thick apical coma, leaf bases hidden; stems appearing atomentose but tomentum hidden in the bases of branch innovations; leaves not fragile, intact; leaves often strongly squarrose-recurved when wet, plane, not undulate; proximal laminal cells thick-walled and brownish, intergrading in shape and size with the distal cells, which are often nonpapillose in the area of merger; leaves broadly concave in section; costa at midleaf exposed adaxially by as much as four stereid cells</description>

      <description type="morphology">Plants green or yellow-green, appearing brown proximally, loosely foliose, some leaf bases exposed, only slightly comose at stem apex; stems conspicuously tomentose; leaves fragile or not, erect- to erect-spreading when wet; undulate or plane; proximal laminal cells thin-walled and hyaline, sharply differentiated in shape and size from the papillose distal cells, which are papillose in the area of contact; leaves keeled in section, costa in apical region exposed adaxially by up to 2 stereid cells in width or completely covered with an adaxial epidermis of quadrate papillose cells.</description>

      <description type="morphology">Leaves in tight, complex spirals when dry, appearing soft or lax throughout the stem length, not fragile or erose, leaf tips nearly all present; conspicuously undulate; leaf cross section without 2-stratose areas beside the costa, the lamina uniformly 1-stratose, lamina intact, the costa always differentiated into guide cells, stereids and epidermal cells, adaxial stereid layer never disappearing toward the apex, adaxial epidermal layer typically absent apically in a medial groove to two stereid cells in width</description>

      <description type="morphology">Leaves in loose, simple spirals or once circinate when dry, appearing firm or rigid, often fragile and erose, leaf tips often absent; inconspicuously undulate, especially when dry; leaf cross section with 2-stratose areas beside the costa, the lamina irregularly 2-stratose in patches, lamina tattered, costa occasionally appearing undifferentiated in apical region of the leaf, adaxial stereid layer occasionally disappearing toward the apex, epidermal layer may be continuous throughout the leaf length</description>
