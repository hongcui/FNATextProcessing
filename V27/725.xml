  <description type="morphology">Plants dull, green, yellow-green or yellow-brown distally, brown proximally, becoming reddish at higher latitudes and altitudes, elongate.  Stems 1–6 cm, leaves distantly disposed along the stem with the shining leaf bases usually apparent, central strand nearly always absent, rarely present, sclerodermis moderately developed, 2–3(–4) cells deep, cells of the central cylinder rather thick-walled, stems visibly tomentose with dense red-brown radicles, rarely nearly eradiculose in very small stems.  Stem leaves rather soft, uniform in size, strongly crisped or contorted with spirally curled tips when dry, flexuose- to widespreading when moist, long-lanceolate to linear-lanceolate, broadly to narrowly concave or nearly plane proximally to more or less keeled in the apical region, (2–)3–6.5(–7) mm; base somewhat broader than limb, oblong; margins usually shortly and strongly undulate, evenly crenulate-papillose, gradually subulate-acuminate, apex acumination confluent with the mucro, leaves at the extreme stem apex surmounted by a stout, multicellular mucro; costa excurrent as a long, smooth or denticulate mucro or short awn, usually composed of 5–10 rhomboidal cells,  adaxial cells of the costa variable, costa distal to the leaf base to the distal median region covered by an epidermis of quadrate to short-rectangular (2:1) papillose cells, in the distal adaxial region variously with a narrow or broader central groove of exposed, smooth, elongate (8:1) stereid cells, occasionally the groove conspicuous and extensive; proximal laminal cells abruptly differentiated from distal cells, hyaline, laxly thin-walled; distal laminal cells 1-stratose, quadrate, 7–10(–13) µm wide, marginal cells undifferentiated.  Specialized asexual reproduction none except possibly through fragility of the lamina in some populations, or weakness toward the apex.  Sexual condition dioicous, but seldom fruiting; perigoniate plants rare; perigonia apparently few per stem, inner perigonial bracts ovate and abruptly apiculate, scarcely longer than the antheridia, 0.5 mm; perichaetiate plants common; perichaetia numerous on the stem; perichaetial leaves differentiated even in unfertilized perichaetia, slender and erect at the base, long, 5–5.5 mm, somewhat sheathing, distal part, consisting mostly of costa, setaceous-subulate, erect, in fertile plants, stiff and slightly flexuose, distinct and conspicuous above the tightly crisped cauline leaves when dry.  Seta 0.9–2.7(–3.5) cm.  Capsule 1.5–3.3 mm; annulus not vesiculose; operculum 1.5–2 mm; peristome teeth long and spirally wound 2 or 3 times, 1.1–1.4 mm.</description>

      <description type="morphology">Plants red-green, appearing black proximally, densely foliose with a thick apical coma, leaf bases hidden; stems appearing atomentose but tomentum hidden in the bases of branch innovations; leaves not fragile, intact; leaves often strongly squarrose-recurved when wet, plane, not undulate; proximal laminal cells thick-walled and brownish, intergrading in shape and size with the distal cells, which are often nonpapillose in the area of merger; leaves broadly concave in section; costa at midleaf exposed adaxially by as much as four stereid cells</description>
