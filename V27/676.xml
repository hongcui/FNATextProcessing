  <discussion>A chromosome count has not been reported for Pleuridium sullivantii.  Sterile innovations are common, julaceous, solitary, to 5 mm, with leaves bract-like to oblong-acuminate.  Some collections have been misidentified as other species of Pleuridium chiefly because the leaves may appear patent and not tightly julaceous.  However, P. sullivantii is the only species in the flora producing (1) appressed, julaceous leaves on the stem, (2) obovate perichaetial leaves which are abruptly subulate and excurrent, (3) erose-serrulate margin at leaf shoulder, and (4) frequently seemingly stand-alone, julaceous asexual innovations.</discussion>
  <discussion>Pleuridium mexicanum Cardot has been recently found in California.  It would key to P. sullivantii but differs by having entire perichaetial leaves and vermiculose spores.</discussion>
