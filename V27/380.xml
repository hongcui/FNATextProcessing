  <discussion>Bucklandiella pacifica occurs at low elevations from southern Vancouver Island southwards to central California.  It is the only species of the genus in North America that has consistently muticous leaves lacking a hyaline hair-point.  In addition, the species is readily distinguished by the entirely unistratose laminal cells, including leaf margins, narrowly obtuse to acute leaf apex, absence of a basal marginal border, differentiated alar cells sometimes forming an auriculate group, and long-cylindrical capsules with prominently flaring peristome teeth.  Bucklandiella pacifica has often been mistaken for Codriophorus depressus, a narrow endemic of California, Nevada, and Oregon (for differences see under 5. Codriophorus depressus), and it is likely to be mistaken for C. ryszardii and muticous ecads of C. varius.  However, those species are immediately distinct by having distinctly papillose laminal cells with large, flat papillae.  The former is additionally easily distinct in having erose-dentate and cristate leaf apices, longer leaves (3.2–4 mm), and stronger costa that is 4-stratose with 5–8 large adaxial cells in the basal part, whereas the latter has a distinct 1–2-seriate basal marginal border and distinctly plicate leaf base.</discussion>
