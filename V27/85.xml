  <discussion>Sporophytes are not common in Sphagnum bartlettianum. Confusion is most likely with
        S. rubellum, with which it frequently co-occurs in the northern part of its range. The
        ecology is poorly understood due to taxonomic confusion with S. rubellum; the latter
        species, however, is more typical of boreal poor fens and bogs. Sphagnum bartlettianum has a
        narrower stem leaf with a distinctly pointed and even apiculate tip, whereas the stem leaf
        on S. rubellum is quite rounded. The branch leaves of S. bartlettianum are also narrower
        than those of S. rubellum and are never subsecund as in the latter. Sphagnum quinquefarium
        has shorter and wider stem leaves as well as often having 3 spreading branches per fascicle.
        Sphagnum wilfii can appear quite similar and it does overlap the range of S. bartlettianum
        in coastal British Columbia and southeastern Alaska. Sphagnum wilfii has a stem leaf that is
        triangular to triangular-lingulate in contrast to the narrowly lingulate-triangular stem
        leaf of S. bartlettianum.</discussion>
