The leaves in section often show clearly the adaxially bulging distal cells characteristic of H. involuta, which, however, lacks the laminal papillae superimposed on the mammillae, and is hygrophytic.  It is also quite like Tortella humilis when sterile but may be often be distinguished by its more elongate stems, less crowded leaves, which are not fragile (often fragmenting in squares in Tortella humilis), stronger mucro, and somewhat less obvious proximal V of hyaline cells.  From Trichostomum tenuirostre, it is immediately distinguished in aspect by its somewhat broader leaf apex and less evident extent of differentiated basal cells.  Specimens with short-conic mucros and without sporophytes can be assigned at least tentatively to this species on the rationale that the similar but autoicous Trichostomum planifolium commonly has sporophytes or at least antheridial buds, and the dioicous Weissia inoperculata is extremely rare and possibly introduced.  The leaf apex is commonly reflexed, but occasionally slightly cucullate as in Trichostomum crispulum.  Although the excurrent costa usually ends in a short-conic apiculus, it can approach (for example, in Tennessee, Norris 17134, MO) in robust specimens the narrowly tapering short awn of robust South American collections.</discussion></treatment>
