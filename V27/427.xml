  <discussion>The present concept of Scouleria aquatica is broad, encompassing several forms.  Virtually all the variation is found in the gametophyte.  Leaves vary in size and in particular marginal differentiation: 1-stratose with cells similar or slightly thicker and darker in color, to partially or nearly fully 2-stratose to near the leaf apex.  Smaller plants are found in the northern range of the species (and also in Russia).  Further studies, particularly molecular, could very well differentiate some of these populations as distinct taxa (at the subspecific or specific level).</discussion>
