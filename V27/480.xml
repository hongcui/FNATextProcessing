Leaves as many as 25 pairs, narrowly lanceolate to ovate–lanceolate, acute to sharply acute to short acuminate, to 1.9 × 0.3; dorsal lamina narrowed proximally, ending before or at insertion, infrequently ± decurrent; vaginant laminae 1/2–4/5 leaf length, ± equal, minor lamina ending on or near margin; margin entire, limbate on all laminae, limbidium confluent at apex or ending shortly before apex, extending to base of dorsal lamina, limbidial cells 2–3-stratose; costa percurrent to excurrent, bryoides-type; laminal cells 1-stratose, distinct, smooth, ± bulging, firm-walled, elongate, 7–22 × 4–13 µm, increasing in size toward proximal part of leaf.  Sexual condition rhizoautoicous; perigonia gemmiform, proximal to infertile and fertile stems.  Sporophytes 1 per perichaetium.  Seta to 12 mm.  Capsule theca exserted, ± erect, radially symmetric to inclined, arcuate, bilaterally symmetic, 0.35–1.25 mm; peristome bryoides-type; operculum 0.25–0.3 µm.  Calyptra cucullate, smooth, 0.5 mm. Spores 11–18 µm.</description><habitat>Bare, shaded soil, often among grasses in open Quercus forests and around bases of coastal shrubs;</habitat><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Europe</global_distribution><global_distribution> Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution> Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution> Pacific Islands (New Caledonia, New Zealand)</global_distribution><global_distribution> Australia.</global_distribution><discussion>Fissidens curvatus is distinguished by its delicate dimorphic stems, usually long excurrent costa, limbidium confluent at leaf apex, and slightly elongate laminal cells.
