  <discussion>Subspecies closteri, originally collected near Closter, New Jersey, is the smallest Fissidens in North America: plants are practically stemless.  It is probably more abundant than its distribution reflects but goes unnoticed because of its tiny size.  It is distinguished by its size, a more or less entire leaf margin, small laminal cells, minor lamina narrowed distally to the costa, which is greatly reduced or absent from the proximal leaves, and mitrate calyptra.  Subspecies kiusiuensis (Sakurai) Z. Iwatsuki in China and Japan differs by its crenulate-serrulate leaf margin and prorate calyptral cells.</discussion>
