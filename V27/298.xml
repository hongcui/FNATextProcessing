  <discussion>Schistidium holmenianum does not grow on rock, but rather forms large tufts or mats over soil, or amongst litter and plants in arctic habitats.  Schistidium grandirete grows in similar habitats but also on rock.  The presence of sporophytes, the lighter color of the plants, the absence of orange-brown cell wall coloration, a more papillose costa, and the consistently larger cells separate S. grandirete from S. holmenianum.  Although reported from North America, S. andreaeopsis (Müller Hal.) Lazarenko has been omitted in this treatment.  All specimens that were examined, including those named as S. andreaeopsis, fall into the descriptions of S. holmenianum as provided by Steere and Brassard and H. H. Blom (1998).  According to Blom, S. andreaeopsis has larger and more sinuose distal laminal cells, darker red-orange cell walls, a much weaker costa, and predominantly 1-stratose and denticulate or papillose-denticulate leaf margins.</discussion>
