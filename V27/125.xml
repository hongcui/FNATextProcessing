  <description>Plants minute and budlike or merely small, forming dense turfs or scattered patches; protonema producing chlorophyllose, perpendicular protonematal flaps, which are persistent or disappear after the development of the gametophores.  Stems erect, to 1.5 cm.  Leaves ovate or lanceolate, erect, three-ranked and appressed or spreading, costate or ecostate, cells smooth, rounded-hexagonal or oblong-rhomboid, basal cells elongate.  Sexual condition autoicous; archegonia and antheridia on short stems at the plant base.  Seta straight or flexuose, smooth or papillose.  Capsule exserted, single, cylindric, ovate or shortly oblong-cylindric; peristome of four, single, unsegmented, narrowly triangular, multicellular teeth; annulus absent.  Calyptra mitrate, smooth or plicate, naked.  Spores green to yellowish, 10–16 µm, spheric, smooth or finely papillose.</description>
