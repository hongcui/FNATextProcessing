  <discussion>Campylopus subulatus is known only from two localities in California and one in Oregon.  Although all records of C. subulatus from North America were referred to C. schimperi by J.-P. Frahm and D. H. Vitt (1978), collections made later in California and Oregon proved to be the former species.  Campylopus schimperi grows in compact tufts in alpine habitats and differs from C. subulatus by an abaxially smooth costa, and rectangular, not subquadrate distal laminal cells.  Campylopus subulatus resembles C. tallulensis.  The latter differs by distinct groups of abaxial stereids and adaxial hyalocysts, which are 1/2 as wide as the thickness of the costa.</discussion>
