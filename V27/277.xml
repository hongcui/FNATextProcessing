The perennial, subterranean stem or rhizome system gives rise to upright, above-ground plants in late fall–early winter.  Above-ground plants are produced in abundance during mild, wet winters but less commonly when conditions are dry.  The broadly concave leaves completely surround the globose, cleistocarpous capsules of immersed sporophytes.  The glaucous, blue-green color of the above-ground plants is reminiscent of Bryum argenteum while their cabbage shape resembles a small Funaria gametophyte prior to elongation of seta.</discussion><references heading="SELECTED REFERENCES"><reference>Lawton, E.  1953.
