  <discussion>Ditrichum ambiguum, a western species, is very close to an eastern species, D. tortuloides, but differs in the following morphological characters: stems often branched and taller, 7–20 mm compared to the shorter, 2–5 mm, usually simple stems of D. tortuloides; leaf margins broadly recurved, entire or serrulate at a somewhat blunt apex, compared to the narrowly recurved, serrate to strongly serrate margins from mid-leaf to an acute apex in D. tortuloides; leaf laminae with 2-stratose margins and occasional 2-stratose regions between the margins and the costa in the middle to distal half of the leaf, compared to the 2-stratose regions only on the margins in D. tortuloides; capsules dark brown to reddish, 1.5–3.2 × 0.2–0.5 mm, straight and symmetric to rarely slightly arcuate with an occasionally slightly swollen base, compared to the yellow or light brown, 1–2.5 × 0.2–0.3 mm, curved and asymmetric capsules often with a swollen base in D. tortuloides.  The geographic ranges of the two taxa are quite disparate.  The species has been reported outside North America by B. H. Allen (1994), from Guatemala and Panama.</discussion>
