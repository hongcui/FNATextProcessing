  <description>Plants robust, polytrichoid.  Stems simple or rarely branched.  Leaves with a sheathing base and divergent blade; sheath entire, hyaline-margined; limb firm, serrate-toothed in distal 1/3–1/2, with lamellae restricted to median portion of the limb, the lamina ± uniformly 2-stratose; lamellae entire, the marginal cells in section not differentiated, smooth.  [Capsule ovoid,  strongly dorsiventral, the upper surface flattened and concave with a narrow winged margin, lower surface rounded-convex, with hypophysis short, with conspicious stomata, guard cells surrounded by a circle of thin-walled, hyaline cells; operculum compressed-conic, with elongated oblique beak; peristome none; columella apex flattened and protruding from the central opening of a concave, thickened disc.  Calyptra sparsely hairy to almost smooth.  Spores echinulate.]</description>

  <discussion>Lyellia is a small genus with a disjunctive distribution, with representatives occurring in the Himalayas and eastward, and a single species, L. aspera, at high latitudes in arctic America and eastern Asia.  The capsules are strongly dorsiventral, resembling those of Dawsonia in shape, but without a peristome.  The flattened columella apex projects from the center of the disc like a stopper in a wash basin (Gary L. Smith 1971, fig. 25); the epiphragm remains embedded in the operculum.  The hypophysis has prominent stomata, the guard cells surrounded by a ring of thin-walled, hyaline subsidiary cells, which are sharply differentiated from the surrounding cells of the exothecium.</discussion>
