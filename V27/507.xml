Stems (0.5–)1–2(–4) cm.  Leaves erect spreading or falcate-secund, lanceolate, subulate, 2–3 mm; costa 30–55 µm wide at base, long-excurrent, rough near tip; distal laminal cells mostly quadrate (2–5:1), incrassate; basal laminal cells elongate, alar cells differentiated.  Perichaetial leaves much larger than stem leaves.  Seta short, 1–3 mm.  Capsule immersed in perichaetial leaves, straight; peristome teeth spreading outward when dry.  Spores 16–27 µm.</description><phenology>Capsules mature summer.</phenology><habitat>  Siliceous rock;</habitat><elevation> high elevations;</elevation><global_distribution> Greenland</global_distribution><ca_distribution> Yukon</ca_distribution><global_distribution> Europe.</global_distribution><discussion>A rare high-arctic species, Arctoa anderssonii was once considered a variety of A. fulvella, but is distinguished by a short seta, large perichaetial leaves, and straight, immersed capsule.  It has a costa that is more shortly excurrent than that of A. fulvella but longer than that of A. hyperborea.</discussion></treatment>
