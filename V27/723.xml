  <discussion>In the United States, all specimens named Tortella flavovirens that were collected inland from coastal habitats were redetermined to be some other species: most frequently T. humilis, Trichostomum crispulum, and Weissia species.  The leaf cross section of Tortella flavovirens exhibits an adaxial layer of quadrate, papillose cells across its surface throughout the leaf length excepting the proximal region and the extreme apex.  The peristome of Tortella flavovirens is somewhat short, but not rudimentary.  It is erect or somewhat inclined and reminiscent of Trichostomum peristomes, which are smooth, papillose or striolate and generally erect.  Sterile Weissia species may be confused with T. flavovirens, being pale yellow with the same cell size, and appearing to have a cucullate apex with the marginal basal cells somewhat extending up the leaf: these will, however, have no basal marginal extension on some leaves and the distal leaf margins will be tightly inrolled or incurved to a stronger degree than in any Tortella species; the substrate is frequently inappropriate in these specimens, such as bark at the base of trees or some other woody or humic substrate, likewise inland stations.  Trichostomum crispulum, with which Tortella flavovirens has occasionally been confused, has smaller leaf cells, a broader, chestnut-colored costa and has a U-shaped proximal differentiated area of cells in all leaves.  A. J. E. Smith (1978) recorded T. flavovirens var. glareicola (Christensen) Crundwell &amp; Hyholm from Canada, most likely based on the citation by A. C. Crundwell and E. Nyholm (1962) of a depauperate specimen from Alberta (C. D. Bird 3624), identified by Bird as T. tortuosa.  These plants “with longly tapering acutely pointed leaves” may be one of the peculiar instances of depauperate, large-celled T. tortuosa specimens (see discussion under that species).  R. R. Ireland et al. (1987) considered var. glareicola to be absent from Canada, while L. E. Anderson et al. (1990) excluded it from North America.</discussion>
