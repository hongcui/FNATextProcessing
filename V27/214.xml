  <description>Plants robust. Leaves 3–8(–12) mm, 0.8–1.1 mm wide at mid-limb; cells of mid-limb
        lamina (8–)9–16(–18) × (8–)9–14 µm; costa ending below apex, papillose on abaxial surface of
        sheath and limb; base of costa dark and swollen, more strongly attached to stem than is the
        lamina; with distal leaves often larger and deciduous, but never with loose clusters of
        linear leaves at stem tips.</description>

  <discussion>Only three sporulating specimens of var. norvegica are known (one from Alaska). The
        deciduous leaves undoubtedly act as vegetative propagules.</discussion>
