  <discussion>Grimmia orbicularis is a thermophilous species with a preference for sunny, basic substrates.  In North America it is known only from scattered localities in the Southwest.  It may be confused with G. pulvinata, as both species form comparable hemispherical cushions and usually grow in the same habitat.  However, they differ markedly in both gametophytic and sporophytic characters.  Grimmia orbicularis has leaves with short- to long-rectangular basal juxtacostal cells with thick and nodulose lateral walls, and 1-stratose margins while G. pulvinata has leaves with quadrate to short-rectangular, thin-walled, basal juxtacostal cells and 2-stratose margins.  Grimmia orbicularis has globose to ovoid capsules with broad, orange, cribrose and cleft peristome teeth, and mammillate opercula while G. pulvinata has obovoid capsules with fully developed dark red peristome teeth and rostrate opercula.</discussion>
