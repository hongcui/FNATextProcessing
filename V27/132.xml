Thallose protonematal flaps persistent and usually present.  Stems few, very short, less than 0.05 cm; flagelliform shoots may occur at the base of the stem, 0.2–0.5 cm, with 3-ranked, tightly appressed linear to lanceolate leaves.  Leaves of main stem few, appressed, ovate, acuminate, or obtuse, margins entire or dentate, to 1.2 mm; costa single, weak or absent; laminal cells rhombic or rectangular.  Specialized asexual structures  absent.  Sexual condition: perichaetial and perigonial buds occurring on the same protonema; perichaetial leaves ovate to ovate-lanceolate, concave.  Seta 3–8 mm, straight, smooth, slightly twisted when dry.  Capsule 0.6–1 mm, ovate to shortly oblong-cylindric, straight; operculum conic, obliquely apiculate; peristome usually not splitting or appearing to be more than four.  Calyptra smooth or somewhat plicate, yellowish.  Spores smooth or finely papillose, 10–16 µm.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 2 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America (Chile)</global_distribution><global_distribution> Eurasia</global_distribution><us_distribution> Pacific Islands (New Zealand).</us_distribution><key><key_statement><statement_id>1.</statement_id><statement>Plants with numerous flagelliform shoots, protonematal flaps less than 0.5 mm</statement><determination>1.
