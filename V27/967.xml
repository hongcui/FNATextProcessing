  <discussion>The bordered, coarsely toothed leaf margins and narrow, rigidly erect gemmiferous
        leaves make Syrrhopodon texanus easy to recognize. The gemmiferous leaves arise annually at
        the stem tips; old plants may have several zones of gemmiferous leaves along the stem
        representing annual increments, these separated by zones of vegetative leaves. In larger
        plants, proximal portions of the stems may be felted with rhizoids. Populations of this moss
        from interior states in the flora area are female or apparently asexual; male plants and
        sporophytes are known only from a relatively few sites along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts,
        and from a single station in northwestern Alabama (Marion County).</discussion>
