Although the leaf apices of var. gallinula are ovate and somewhat cucullate, lacking an apiculus, certain undoubted var. convoluta specimens match them; thus the axillary gemmae are needed for sure identification.  This taxon is apparently fairly abundant at Virginia Falls on the South Nahanni River, Northwest Territories.</discussion></treatment>
