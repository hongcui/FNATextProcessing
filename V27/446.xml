  <description>Plants small, dark-brown to blackish.  Leaves lanceolate, stoutly subulate from oblong base, narrowly obtuse; costa ending in apex, filling subula; margins entire; leaf cells (1–)2:1; perichaetial leaves somewhat larger, similar to vegetative leaves, not much differentiated.  Seta 0.8–1.2 mm, straight to slightly curved, stout.  Capsule hemispheric-obovate to turbinate and flaring at mouth when old; peristome reduced to 16, short, blunt teeth; columella exserted.  Spores (20–)23–28(–30) µm.</description>

  <discussion>Seligeria oelandica is rare and disjunctive, known only from a few stations in eastern Quebec and from several localities in Alaska, Northwest Territories, and the Yukon.  It is distinguished from its closest relative, S. tristichoides, by the branched turf-forming habit, twisted-curved leaves, pronounced turbinate capsules, larger spores, and reduced peristome.  The spores are the largest in the genus; that and the persistent columella distinguish this species from all others.</discussion>
