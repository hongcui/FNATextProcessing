  <discussion>Encalypta flowersiana is recognized by its small size, narrow leaves, subpercurrent costa, and distinctly ridged spores.  The species is similar to E. mutica and E. texana in the absence of a peristome and leaf awn.  The most useful difference is spore ornamentation (see the discussions with those species).  Currently, E. flowersiana is known in the flora area only from the Chisos Mountains of western Texas, but its small size and the rugged terrain of its habitat may mask a broader distribution in the mountains of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</discussion>
