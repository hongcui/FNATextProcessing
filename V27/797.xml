  <discussion>Didymodon nevadensis is similar to Pseudocrossidium crinitum and has much the same appearance under the dissecting microscope.  It differs by the somewhat cucullate, acute leaf apex, the costa percurrent (not excurrent as a short awn, smaller distal laminal cells (13–15 µm for P. crinitum), and occasional presence of tubers on the proximal rhizoids.  Like P. crinitum, D. nevadensis has blotches of red coloration at mid leaf and above, and this irregular red coloration distinguishes it from Bryoerythrophyllum species, which are evenly colored red.  This species has two layers of guide cells (occasionally to three near the leaf base), while P. crinitum is nearly constant in a single layer of guide cells.  Unlike B. columbianum, which has somewhat the same apearance and rather broad distal costa, the leaf apices of D. nevadensis are not fragile and specialized asexual reproduction is by several-celled spheric propagula born on rhizoids in the proximal leaf axils, as well as occasionally by brood bodies on the rhizoids.  This species differs further from B. columbianum by the blunt, rather cucullate leaf apices comprised of nearly isodiametric cells, and leaf margins more loosely recurved to revolute.  Didymodon australasiae is similar to D. nevadensis but its leaves differ in the thin-walled proximal cells and 2-stratose distal margins; small plants of D. australasiae are quite similar to D. nevadensis, especially in the appearance of the leaf apex, the rather broad and adaxially protuberant costa, the double layer of guide cells and lack of an adaxial stereid band, and the few-celled propagula borne on proximal rhizoids, but the former has 2-stratose cells in the leaf apices.  Didymodon nevadensis differs from the very similar Tortula atrovirens in its ovate leaf shape, deep groove at the leaf apex, smaller leaf cells, and very weak, flattened abaxial stereid band, the latter having a short oblong leaf shape, broadly channeled leaf apex, large leaf cells (to 18 µm wide) and strong, rounded stereid band; S. Flowers (1973, plate 31) treated and illustrated both species under the name Desmatodon convolutus.</discussion>
