  <discussion>Schistidium boreale is one of the five species of the genus in North America with papillose distal laminal cells.  The combination of its dull black color, usually turning purplish when wet, reddish or orange laminal cell walls, and ovoid-cylindrical capsules that are narrowed at the mouth separates this species from the other papillose taxa.  Schistidium papillosum  is usually olivaceous and lacks colored cell walls; S. strictum  is usually a dull red-brown, has cupulate capsules, and appears to be restricted to northwestern, coastal areas, and S. frisvollianum, an arctic species, is more strongly ornamented.  None of these three taxa turns purple when wet.  Schistidium maritimum  occasionally has papillose distal laminal cells.  That species, however, is restricted to coastal areas, its leaves are ovate-lanceolate to linear-lanceolate with 2-stratose distal laminae, and its costa has one or two well-developed stereid bands, which are absent in all other North American species of the genus.</discussion>
