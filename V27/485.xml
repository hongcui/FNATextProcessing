  <discussion>Fissidens sublimbatus is closely allied to F. crispus but is restricted to arid habitats.  Indeed, it appears to be the only species of the genus found in Death Valley.  Stems of F. sublimbatus are dimorphic, unlike the monomorphic stems of F. crispus.  Leaves of infertile stems are small, ovate-lanceolate and usually apiculate, the apiculus formed by a single, clear, sharp cell.  The dorsal lamina in these leaves usually ends well before the insertion, are often arched, and the limbidium is most often restricted to the vaginant laminae but can be absent.  The 1-stratose limbidium is best developed on perichaetial and larger leaves, but ends below the leaf apex and is usually edged by distinctly chlorophyllose cells.  The percurrent costa occurs mostly in perichaetial leaves.  As in F. crispus, the distal laminal cells are arranged in distinct rows.</discussion>
