Leaves erect or slightly curved when dry, ovate-lanceolate, occa-sionally linear-lanceolate, keeled distally, 1.7–2.6 mm, 1-stratose; margins usually recurved to apex, smooth or weakly toothed, 2-stratose or 1-stratose in spots; apices acute; costa percurrent or short-excurrent as a smooth or weakly denticulate, occasionally decurrent awn, abaxial surface sometimes papillose; basal marginal cells short-rectangular or quadrate; distal cells mostly short-rectangular, 11–14 µm wide, strongly sinuose.  Sexual condition autoicous.  Capsule orange- or red-brown, short-cylindric or cupulate, 0.7–1.1 mm; exothecial cells usually isodiametric, quadrate or irregularly angular, usually mixed with a few elongate cells, thin-walled, trigonous; stomata present or absent; peristome patent to squarrose-recurved, often twisted, 330–530 µm, bright red, papillose, usually strongly perforated.
