  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Plants cespitose, to 110 cm. Roots basal, 1.5–4 mm diam. Stems unbranched, straight, compressed, to 60 cm. Leaves 5–13; petiole 20–36 mm; blade elliptic, obtuse, middle ones somewhat larger than basal or apical, 4–18 × 1–4 cm, leathery. Inflorescences racemes, subcapitate, densely flowered, 10–50 cm; 1st raceme terminal, producing additional racemes from nodes of long peduncle over years; peduncle elongate, laterally compressed, 9–48 cm. Flowers to 25 per raceme, not resupinate, spirally oriented, yellow-green to red-brown; sepals obovate-elliptic, 5.5–7.5 × 3–4 mm, fleshy, apex obtuse; petals narrowly oblanceolate, thin, 5–7 × 0.5–1 mm, apex obtuse; lip cordate, apex 2-lobed, 4–6 × 4.5–7 mm, fleshy, with prominent longitudinal ridge terminating in fleshy mucro; column 5 mm; anther ovoid, apex saddle-shaped; ovary 7–14 mm. Capsules subglobose; pedicel 6.5 mm; body 7.5 × 6 mm; beak obsolete.</description><phenology>dec</phenology><phenology>winter</phenology><phenology>jan</phenology><phenology>feb</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><habitat>widespread and common in forests and hammocks of the big cypress swamp and everglades</habitat><habitat>on deciduous trees and palms</habitat><elevation>0–30 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Fla.</us_distribution><global_distribution>West Indies (Cuba).</global_distribution><discussion>Epidendrum amphistomum grows in Martin, Lee, Collier, Miami-Dade, and Monroe counties, Florida.</discussion><discussion>The species is pollinated by male night moths: Eucereon carolina, Lymire edwardsii, Cisseps fulvicollis, and Oxydia vesulia. Its reproduction is obligately allogamous. Flowers produce a fragrance reminiscent of overly ripe vegetables, heaviest between late afternoon and dawn (R. M. Adams and G. J. Goss 1976). </discussion><discussion>This name has been generally regarded as synonymous with Epidendrum anceps Jacquin, which L. A. Garay and H. R. Sweet (1974) considered synonymous with Epidendrum secundum Jacquin (E. Hágsater 1993).</discussion><discussion>Outside the flora area are several closely related species, all of them having been considered by recent authors under the name Epidendrum anceps.</discussion><references>
