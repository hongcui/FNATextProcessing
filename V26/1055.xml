Ackerman</author><description>Herbs, terrestrial, sympodial. Roots fleshy, villous. Stems succulent, glabrous. Leaves cauline, sessile [petiolate], not articulate; blade convolute, conduplicate, often membranous. Inflorescences terminal, dense spikes [racemes]; flowers spirally arranged; floral bracts mostly longer than flowers, membranaceous, scarious. Flowers fewâ€“many, resupinate, white with yellow lip, small, scarcely opening; sepals subequal; dorsal sepal erect, connivent with petals, forming hood over column; lateral sepals distinct and free, enclosing base of lip; lip pandurate, broadly rounded, margins entire, apex slightly broadened to winglike; column short; anther abaxial, 2-chambered, membranous; pollinia 2, sometimes 2-lobed, pyriform, sectile, caudicles present or absent; stigmas 2, on either side of column, convex; rostellum large, deeply divided. Fruits capsules, erect, ovoid [subglobose].</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 30 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><introduced>introduced;</introduced><global_distribution>tropical and subtropical regions</global_distribution><global_distribution>Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution>Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution>Australia</global_distribution><global_distribution>Pacific Islands</global_distribution><global_distribution>1 species has escaped in parts of the Neotropics.</global_distribution></treatment>
