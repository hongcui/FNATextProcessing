G. Voss 1972–1985, vol. 1). Because C. forbesii Baker, distinguished by its taller scapes (to 30 cm), with more numerous (4–10), slightly larger, and slightly pendent flowers, is more widely cultivated, often as “C. luciliae,” both it and C. luciliae are expected to be naturalized elsewhere.</discussion></treatment>
