Stems 1–several, erect, mostly simple, occasionally 1–3-branched. Leaf blade linear, often twisted, flat to concavo-convex, widest considerably beyond middle, 25–60 × 1.2–1.7 cm, glaucous, smooth, margins minutely denticulate, lemon yellow, hyaline, apex spinose, spine tipped. Inflorescences paniculate, arising just within or beyond rosettes, ovoid, 3–10 dm; branches up to 3.8 dm; bracts erect; peduncle sometimes scapelike, 0.3–1 m, less than 2.5 cm diam., glabrous or glabrescent. Flowers pendent; perianth globose to campanulate; tepals distinct, white, narrowly ovate, 4.2–5.2 × 1.1–2 cm, apex sharply acuminate; filaments 1.7–2 cm; pistil 2.5–3.5 cm; style white, 6–14 mm; stigmas lobed. Fruits erect, capsular, dehiscent, ovoid to ellipsoid, rarely constricted, 4–7 × 1.8–2.5 cm, dehiscence septicidal.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><habitat>rocky mountain slopes</habitat><habitat>canyon bottoms</habitat><elevation>700 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Tex.</us_distribution><global_distribution>n Mexico (Coahuila).</global_distribution><discussion>In the United States, Yucca rostrata is restricted to Brewster County, Texas.
