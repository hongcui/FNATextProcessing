  <discussion>Epidendrum floridense is pollinated by male night moths: Anticarsia gemmatilis, Phyprosopus callitrichoides, and Lymire edwardsii (G. J. Goss 1977). The flowers produce copious nectar within the nectar tube; in some cases nectar overflows, and a drop is found in front of the callus. The species is threatened because of increasing intensities of winter freezes.</discussion>
  <discussion>Previous authors have cited this species as Epidendrum difforme Jacquin and considered it to be highly variable and widespread throughout the Neotropics. Field and herbarium studies have shown that it is not a single highly variable species but rather a complex of about 50 species (L. M. Sánchez and E. Hágsater 1997). Most of these can be easily recognized by a series of characters including: terete or compressed stems, simultaneous or successive flowering, few or many flowers, shape of the lip and petals, veining, fimbriation of the clinandrium, shape of the nectarium, presence or absence of nectar, distribution, and ecological and elevational preferences. Thus many names previously relegated to synonymy are being recognized, and many new species described. The Florida plants are clearly distinct from the true Epidendrum difforme, which, among other characteristics, has stems that are strongly compressed laterally and is endemic to the Windward Antilles.</discussion>
