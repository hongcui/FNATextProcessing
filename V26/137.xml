    <description>Rhizomes horizontal, white, slender, elongated, brittle. Scapes typically 1(–3),
        round in cross section, 1.5–4.8 dm, slender to robust, glabrous. Bracts held well above
        ground, strongly petiolate; blade at first strongly mottled in darker green or bronze,
        mottling fading with seasonal expansion after anthesis, rarely all green, ovate, elliptic,
        or lanceolate, 6–18 × 2.5–6.5 cm, not glossy, apex acuminate; petiole ca. 1/5 bract length.
        Flower erect, fragrance not reported; sepals strongly recurved basally and held against
        scape by turgor pressure, green, sometimes purple-streaked, ovate-lanceolate, 18–35 × 6–18
        mm, margins entire, apex acute; petals long-lasting, erect, ± connivent, ± concealing
        stamens and ovary, dark maroon purple to clear yellow, occasionally 2-colored with purple
        and yellow, not spirally twisted, lanceolate to ovate, 1.8–4.8 × 0.9–2 cm, thick-textured,
        base attenuate to weakly clawed, margins entire, apex acute; stamens incurved, 10–15 mm;
        filaments erect, dark purple, 4–6 mm, ± slender; anthers strongly incurved above filaments,
        dark purple, 5–16 mm, ± thick, dehiscence introrse; connectives strongly incurved inward,
        dark purple, projecting about 1 mm beyond anther sacs; ovary greenish with ± purple stains
        distally, transversely rhombic to angular-ovate, somewhat 6-angled or -winged, 7–10 mm, ±
        equaling filament height; stigmas erect, divergent-recurved, distinct, ± linear, 4–6 mm,
        slightly thickened basally. Fruits green to white- and purple-streaked, odorless,
        rhomboid-ovoid, 6-angled, almost winged, ca. 1 cm diam., pulpy. 2n = 10.</description>

    <discussion>Trillium recurvatum has several named color forms, most notably forma shayi E. J.
        Palmer &amp; Steyermark with clear yellow petals, and one foliose anomaly (possibly caused
        by mycoplasma).</discussion>
