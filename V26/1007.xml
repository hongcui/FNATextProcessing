Stems twining counterclockwise, climbing to more than 7 m, terete, grooved, or weakly angled with variable number of longitudinal ridges raised less than 1 mm adaxially, producing axillary bulbils frequently greater than 5 cm diam. in leaf axils. Leaves alternate at basal nodes, opposite distally, 6–27 × 7–42 cm; petiole 6–20 cm, as long as or slightly longer than blade, base clasping, basal lobes stipulate, 1–8 mm wide; blade 7–11-veined, reniform to somewhat deltate, glabrous, margins irregularly 3–5-lobed, apex conspicuously caudate. Staminate inflorescences 1–2(–4) per axil, spicate or terminally paniculate, cymose; cymes subsessile, bearing (1–)2–4 flowers subtended by ovate bracteoles, internodes ca. 1 cm; rachis 20–40 cm, subtended by ovate bracts ca. 1 mm. Pistillate inflorescences 1–3 per axil, to 80 cm, internodes 2–2.5 cm. Staminate flowers: perianth yellowish; tepals in 2 similar whorls, narrowly spreading at anthesis, lanceolate, 3–6 mm; fertile stamens 6 in 2 subequal whorls; anthers less than ½ length of filaments, thecae distinct, not spreading. Pistillate flowers: perianth white with purple veins; tepals as in staminate flowers; staminodes 6, smaller than fertile stamens; style branches irregularly 2-fid. Capsules not reflexed at maturity, longer than wide. Seeds bilaterally winged.</description><habitat>not known to flower in the flora area. roadsides</habitat><habitat>hammocks</habitat><habitat>swamps</habitat><elevation>0 m;</elevation><introduced>introduced;</introduced><us_distribution>Fla.</us_distribution><global_distribution>tropical Africa.</global_distribution><discussion>Dioscorea sansibarensis, an ornamental species native to tropical Africa, is widely cultivated for its large, unusually shaped leaves. It has recently been reported growing amongst native vegetation in Miami-Dade and Collier counties in southern Florida. Axillary bulbils shed from mature plants were observed to be growing vigorously. Both the tubers and axillary bulbils of this species are toxic.</discussion></treatment>
