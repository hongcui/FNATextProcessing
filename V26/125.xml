    <description>Rhizomes horizontal, brownish, thick, praemorse, not brittle. Scapes 1–3, green or
        bronze-green, round in cross section, 1.7–4.4 dm, stout, glabrous. Bracts held horizontally,
        not drooping, tips at anthesis held well above ground, sessile; blade usually very strongly
        marked with at least 3 shades of dark green, bronze green, and purplish green, often with
        light central strip, mottling becoming obscure with age, ovate-lanceolate to lanceolate,
        widest at ca. 1/3 of length from basal attachment, tapered very gradually to tip, 8–17+ ×
        4.9–8.5 cm, rounded basally, margins of distal 1/3 straight, apex acute. Flower faintly
        ill-scented; sepals divergent-ascending, streaked with green to maroon, lanceolate to
        ovate-lanceolate, 36–68 × 12–21 mm, margins entire, flat or slightly raised adaxially, apex
        acute; petals long-lasting, erect, ± connivent, ± partially concealing stamens and ovary,
        maroon-purple, brownish purple to brown, greenish streaked to green, rarely yellow, becoming
        brown, or occasionally bright copper-bronze with age, not spirally twisted, veins not
        engraved, obovate to oblanceolate, large in proportion to leaf size compared to many
        species, 5–9 × 1–2 cm, 2+ times longer than wide, widest at or just above middle,
        thick-textured, margins entire, flat, apex acute, obtuse, or rounded; stamens erect or
        incurving, 12–24 mm; filaments yellow, 2–3 mm; anthers erect, straight, rarely arcuate,
        yellow, 10–15 mm, dehiscence latrorse; connectives straight, projecting 1–2 mm beyond anther
        sacs; ovary dark red, brown, or gray, ellipsoid, strongly 6-angled, 6–13 mm; stigmas basally
        erect, tips recoiled upon ovary, distinct, green, white, or purple, linear, short, 3–12 mm,
