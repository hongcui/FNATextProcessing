Leaves: basal 4–9, 33–60 cm × 10–20 mm, blade linear to elliptic, margins denticulate; cauline 4–5, blade long-acuminate, the proximal (4.3–)10–20 cm, frequently exceeding next node.

Flowers nodding; tepals broadly elliptic, 12–19 mm, outer 2–3 mm wide, inner 5–8 mm wide; filaments inserted in covered pits, narrowly clavate, 5–9 mm; anthers connate, forming cone 4–5.5 mm, cone weakly to strongly tapered, 2–3 mm wide, apex broadly and deeply lobed, 1–1.5 mm; ovary 2–3.5 mm.

The anther cone of E. reflexa is longer and narrower, and the apex is narrower and minutely lobed.</discussion></treatment>
