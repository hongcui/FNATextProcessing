Leaves usually deciduous with scape, withering from tip at anthesis, 1–2, basally sheathing, sheaths not extending much above soil surface; blade solid, straight or weakly falcate, flat or broadly channeled, 10–30 cm × 1–21 mm, margins entire. Scape usually forming abcission layer and deciduous with leaves after seeds mature, frequently breaking at this level after pressing, solitary, erect, solid, terete, 2–12 cm × 1–3 mm. Umbel persistent, erect, compact, 20–30-flowered, hemispheric, bulbils unknown; spathe bracts persistent, 2–4(–6), 10–16-veined, ovate, ± equal, apex acuminate. Flowers campanulate, 7–14 mm; tepals erect, white or pink to purplish with dark greenish brown or purple midveins, lance-oblong, elliptic, or ± oblanceolate, ± equal, becoming papery and investing fruit, margins entire, apex obtuse; stamens included; anthers yellow; pollen yellow; ovary crested; processes 3, central, rounded, minute, margins entire; style linear, equaling stamens; stigma capitate, scarcely thickened, unlobed; pedicel 5–18 mm.
