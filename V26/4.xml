  <description>Herbs, annual or perennial, rooting in mud or free-floating. Vegetative stems
    submersed and growing to surface, or emersed and short. Flowering stems emersed. Sessile leaves
    forming basal rosette or alternate on elongate vegetative stem; apex acuminate. Petiolate leaves
    floating or emersed; blade cordate to ovate or round, coriaceous, apex obtuse. Inflorescences
    spicate, up to 30-flowered, elongating over several days; spathes folded, with acuminate to
    caudate extension. Flowers open 1 day only; perianth with tepals connate for more than 1/2 its
    length, blue, mauve, or rarely white, funnelform, limb lobes obovate to oblanceolate, longer
    than 2 cm, glandular-pubescent, apex obtuse to acute; stamens 6, distal 3 shorter than proximal
    3; filaments curved upward near apex, purple, glandular-pubescent; anthers yellow, rounded to
    oblong; ovary incompletely 3-locular; ovules many; style 3-lobed. Fruits capsular, elongate.
    Seeds 10–200, ovoid, testa with longitudinal wings.</description>

  <discussion>Eichhornia paniculata (Sprengel) Solms-Laubach [syn. Piaropus paniculatus (Sprengel)
    Small] was reported by J. K. Small (1913) as occurring in drainage ditches of peninsular
    Florida. The collection was made in 1907 in Manatee County (J. K. Small s.n., NY). This species
    can be recognized by its growing rooted in mud and by the presence of cordate leaves and an
    elongate flowering stem terminated by a panicule of 20–100 flowers.</discussion>
  <discussion>Eichhornia diversifolia (Vahl) Urban, native to Puerto Rico, is not known to occur in
    the flora area.</discussion>
