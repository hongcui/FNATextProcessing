The white, glossy, forked appendages on the filaments of this species are very different from those found in B. appendiculata and B. californica and perhaps are not homologous. Also, the capsule is unique in the genus in that it does not split at maturity and is transparent. All other members of the genus have mature capsules that either split and are transparent, or do not split and are opaque.</discussion></treatment>
