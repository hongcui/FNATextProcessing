Leaf blade lanceolate, straight, flat except becoming concave near apex, widest above middle, 20–50 × 1–4.5 cm, flexible, glaucous, margins denticulate or sometimes wavy, yellow. Inflorescences paniculate, often distally racemose, arising beyond rosettes, 7–12 dm, with wide-spreading branchlets 1.5–2.3 dm; bracts erect; peduncle scapelike, 0.6–1.3 m, less than 2.5 cm diam., glaucous. Flowers pendent; perianth campanulate; tepals distinct, greenish white, elliptic to ovate, 5–6.5 × 2–3.2 cm; filaments 1.8–3.2 cm; pistil 3.2–4 cm; style white, 13–20 mm; stigmas lobed. Fruits erect, capsular, dehiscent, oblong-cylindric, 4.5–5.5 × 1.3–2 cm, dehiscence septicidal. Seeds dull black, thin, 5–7 mm diam.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><habitat>rocky prairies and uplands</habitat><habitat>rarely limestone hills</habitat><elevation>100–400 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Tex.</us_distribution><discussion>Yucca pallida is endemic to the blackland prairies of Texas and was originally included in Y. rupicola. J. M. Webber (1953) indicated that he found plants of Y. rupicola with key features similar to those of Y. pallida. Occasionally, plants with entire margins are found; these have been called Y. pallida var. edentata, which S. D. McKelvey (1938–1947) suggested might be a hybrid between Y. pallida and Y. arkansana. K. H. Clary (1997) indicated that DNA evidence confirms the close relationship of Y. pallida and Y. rupicola.</discussion></treatment>
