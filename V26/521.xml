Umbel persistent, erect, loose, 30–90-flowered, globose, bulbils unknown; spathe bracts persistent, 2–5, 10–15-veined, lanceolate to broadly ovate, ± equal, apex acuminate. Flowers stellate, 8–15 mm; tepals spreading, bright pink to rose, narrowly lanceolate, ± equal, becoming erect, rigid, constricted distal to ovary in fruit, margins entire, apex long-acuminate; stamens exserted; anthers yellow; pollen gray; ovary crestless; style linear, equaling stamens; stigma capitate, scarcely thickened, unlobed, apex acute; pedicel 10–25 mm. Seed coat dull or shining; cells smooth. 2n = 14.</description><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><habitat>rocky, sandy slopes</habitat><elevation>1500–2500 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Nev.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Oreg.</us_distribution></treatment>
