The following have been recorded as persisting for some years around abandoned dwellings, in cemeteries and garbage dumps, and along roads and highways: W. borbonica (Pourret) Goldblatt (both pink- and white-flowered forms), W. fourcadei J. W. Mathews &amp; L. Bolus, and W. marginata (Linnaeus f.) Ker Gawler.</discussion><references>
