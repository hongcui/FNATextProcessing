  <discussion>Subspecies vollmeri is narrowly endemic to the Siskiyou Mountains serpentine in extreme northwestern California and adjacent Oregon. A collection from near Wimer in Jackson County, Oregon, evidently represents the northernmost extent of this taxon. To the south it intergrades with subsp. pardalinum, but it can usually be told by its somewhat smaller and often redder flowers, and its narrowly elliptic or linear leaves that are often concentrated proximally on the stem. Northern populations in Curry County, Oregon, and those in the shade are rather similar to subsp. pardalinum, though the plants are usually less clonal. In the eastern part of its range, for example near Grayback Mountain in Josephine County, Oregon, and near Sanger Peak in Del Norte County, California, it intergrades extensively with subsp. wigginsii, producing swarms of individuals that vary in leaf arrangement and shape, and flower and anther coloration.</discussion>
