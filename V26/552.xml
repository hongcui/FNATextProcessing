  <discussion>Hymenocallis pygmaea was described from bulbs collected by Mary G. Henry along a small tributary of the Waccamaw River in South Carolina. Populations that we have studied and vouchered from the Waccamaw River drainage are characterized by extremely narrow, coriaceous, nearly erect, shiny leaves and small flowers. This species could be considered a cytological and/or ecological variant of H. crassifolia, but because of its smaller stature and features it is maintained here as a separate species. Additional studies on the dwarf spider-lilies of the Atlantic Coastal Plain should be undertaken to clarify their taxonomic status.</discussion>
