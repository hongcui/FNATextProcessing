Leaves erect or erect-ascending, 50–63(–73) × 7.5–9 cm; blade glaucous-gray to -bluish, cross-zoned, lanceolate or oblanceolate, rigid, adaxially concave, abaxially convex; margins straight or repand, armed, teeth single, well defined, 3.5–5 mm, 1–3 cm apart, interstitial teeth (3–)6–12, mostly along distal 2/3 of margins; apex conspicuously incurved, spine brownish gray, slender, 2.8–3.5(–4.9) cm. Scape 4.5–6 m. Inflorescences broadly paniculate, not bulbiferous, open; bracts persistent, triangular, 1–5.5 cm; lateral branches 12–17, horizontal, comprising distal 3/5–5/8 of inflorescence, longer than 10 cm.

The plant is probably a cultivar derived from A. palmeri or a closely related taxon by pre-Columbian people. Agave delamateri hybridizes with A. chrysantha, acting as a pollen donor.</discussion></treatment>
