Straley†</author><author>Frederick H. Utech</author><description>Herbs perennial, scapose, from brown, tunicate, ovoid bulbs, with or without offsets (bulblets). Leaves (1–)2–7, basal; blade linear, sometimes sulcate, glabrous, rather fleshy. Scape terete. Inflorescences terminally racemose, many-flowered, dense, bracteate, usually elongating in fruit; distal flowers smaller, sterile, differing in color, forming a tuft (coma); bracts minute. Flowers fragrant; perianth tubular to urceolate, usually constricted basally; tepals 6, connate most of their length, distal portions distinct, reflexed, short, toothlike; stamens 6, epitepalous, in 2 rows, included; anthers dark blue, dorsifixed, globose; ovary superior, green, 3-locular, inner sepal nectaries present; style 1; stigma 3-lobed. Fruits capsular, obtusely 3-angled, papery, dehiscence loculicidal. Seeds 6, black, globose, wrinkled to reticulate. x = 9.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species ca. 30 (3 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><introduced>introduced;</introduced><global_distribution>temperate Europe</global_distribution><global_distribution>n Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution>sw Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution>expected introduced elsewhere.</global_distribution><discussion>Various species and cultivated forms of Muscari are commonly grown for their early spring flowers.

Herbarium specimens of that species are difficult to distinguish from those of M. neglectum, but live specimens of M. armeniacum have much paler blue flowers (A.
