Searches since then have failed to find any more plants (C. A. Luer 1975; J. Liggio and A. Liggio 1999). The Texas plants were originally identified as Spiranthes durangensis Ames &amp; C. Schweinfurth (D. S. Correll 1950). They were subsequently placed in Deiregyne and described as D. confusa Garay. L. A. Garay (1980[1982]) stated that D. durangensis does not occur in the United States.</discussion></treatment>
