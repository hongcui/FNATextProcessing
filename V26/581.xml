  <discussion>In the original description of Zephyranthes citrina, Baker stated that Messrs. Veitch (Chelsea, England) brought it to him in flower and that they believed it had come to them from Demerara (Guyana). The type specimen is in the Kew Herbarium, where there are also specimens of this species from areas where it clearly is not native: tropical Africa, the Malay Peninsula, and India. It is also found in the West Indies (Cuba) and Central America (Panama). This species has naturalized widely from cultivation, and considerably more work is needed to determine its native distribution.</discussion>
