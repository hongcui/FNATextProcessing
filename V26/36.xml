    <description>Stems leafless, or with 1–3 leaves towards base, 20–70 cm, coarsely
        glandular-pubescent below inflorescence. Leaf blades to 35 cm × 6 mm. Inflorescences
        racemose, 15–80-flowered, usually open, 3–22 cm; bracts subtending pedicel in cluster;
        bracteoles shallowly 3-lobed or cleft from proximal 1/3 to base, lobes acute or rounded,
        usually glandular. Flowers borne in clusters of (2–)3(–7), proximal sometimes remote;
        perianth white, drying orange; tepals 2.5–5 mm, inner series narrower, longer; stamens
        2.5–4.5 mm; ovary ellipsoid to cylindrical, usually tapering abruptly to style base, forming
        rounded shoulder; styles connate basally into column 1/4–2/3 their length, 1–1.8 mm; pedicel
        2–12 mm. Capsules ovoid to subglobose, 3–5 mm, ± equaling or slightly longer than tepals and
        ± enclosed by them, hard. Seeds reddish brown, ca. 1 mm; appendages 1 or 2 with one at one
        end ca. 1/2 to equaling seed, one at opposite end often much shorter; coat
        absent.</description>

    <discussion>Specimens of Triantha collected in Burlington County, New Jersey, have generally
        been determined as T. racemosa. However, the population is variable, and while there are
        aspects in some of these plants suggestive of T. racemosa that would explain the
        determinations, others are closer morphologically to T. glutinosa. This is seen in the
        typical “glutinosa” glands, the narrower, less-spreading bracteoles that usually lack
        glandular hairs, the more-ascending pedicels, the shorter internodes in most inflorescences,
        and the chartaceous capsules. I suppose that in the past the two species had overlapping
        ranges in this northeastern region where they no longer are found, and that some
        hybridization between T. glutinosa and T. racemosa has occurred. The Burlington County
        population is a surviving disjunct remnant with attributes of both species. The specimens
        have been annotated T. glutinosa × T. racemosa, and New Jersey is omitted from the list of
        states in which T. racemosa is found.</discussion>
