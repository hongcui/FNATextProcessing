Stems 0.6–1 m. Leaf blade linear, plano-convex or plano-keeled, widest near middle, 40–65 × 0.3–0.7(–1.5) cm, rigid, margins entire, filiferous, white, apex spinose, spine acicular, 7 mm. Inflorescences paniculate, arising within or occasionally beyond rosettes, narrowly ellipsoid, 6–10 dm, distance from leaf tips to proximal inflorescence branches less than twice leaf length when fully expanded, glabrous; branches to 13 cm; bracts erect; peduncle scapelike, 0.5–1 m, less than 2.5 cm diam. Flowers pendent; perianth globose; tepals connate, dull green, sometimes tinged pink, 4.1–6.5 × 1.5–2.5 cm; filaments shorter than pistil, flaccid; anthers 3.2 mm; pistil ovoid to obovoid, 2.5–3 × 0.5–0.9 cm; style bright green; stigmas lobed. Fruits erect, capsular, dehiscent, symmetrical or rarely constricted, 4.5–5.5(–6.3) × 3–5 cm, dehiscence septicidal. Seeds glossy black, thin, 11–14 × 8–11 mm.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><habitat>deep sands</habitat><elevation>800–900 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Tex.</us_distribution><discussion>Yucca campestris is endemic to the plains region in the southern panhandle counties of western Texas. S. D. McKelvey (1938–1947) discussed its variation in relation to its distribution, and K. H. Clary’s (1997) DNA studies support its recognition as a distinct species. J. M. Webber (1953) considered Y. campestris to be a hybrid between Y. constricta and Y. elata, and reported a distribution from west Texas into southern New Mexico, and possibly into northwestern New Mexico. Additional study within these regions may help resolve the relationships and origin of this species.</discussion></treatment>
