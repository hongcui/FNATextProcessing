Leaves deciduous with scape after seeds mature, 2, basally sheathing, sheaths not extending much above soil surface; blade solid, flat, falcate, 6–15 cm × 2–4 mm, margins entire or obscurely papillose. Scape usually forming abcission layer and deciduous with leaves after seeds mature, frequently breaking at this level after pressing, solitary, erect, solid, strongly flattened, 2-edged or winged distally, wings obscurely papillose, 4–8 cm × 1–3 mm. Umbel decisuous with scape, erect, compact, 5–12-flowered, hemispheric, bulbils unknown; spathe bracts persistent, 2–3, 3-veined, broadly ovate, ± equal, apex acute. Flowers campanulate, 6–8 mm; tepals erect, white or pinkish with green midribs, becoming reddish purple, broadly elliptic-oblong, ± equal, becoming rigid, papery and ± connivent over fruit, margins entire, apex obtuse, not involute at tip; stamens included; anthers purple; pollen white to gray; ovary crestless or obscurely crested; processes 3, central, rounded, margins entire; style linear, equaling stamens; stigma capitate, unlobed or minutely 3-lobed; pedicel 2–10.5(–18.5 in fruit) mm. Seed coat dull; cells smooth. 2n = 14.</description><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><habitat>barren, gravelly soils</habitat><habitat>arid interior slopes and ridges well back from columbia river</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>300–1300 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Wash.</us_distribution><discussion>Allium scilloides is known only from east of the Cascades.</discussion></treatment>
