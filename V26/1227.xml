It is, however, nearly extirpated outside the south-central states. DNA evidence, as well as its hexaploid chromosome number, suggest that this species may be an alloploid, possibly derived from ancient hybridization between C. barbatus and C. tuberosus (D. H. Goldman 2000).</discussion><references>
