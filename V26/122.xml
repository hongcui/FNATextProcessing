It is more frequent east and south of the San Francisco Bay region.</discussion><discussion>J. D. Freeman (1975) determined chemically that all plants of var. chloropetalum have yellow pigment present in petals, though it may be masked by purple. My own quite limited field observations seem to indicate that plants of this variety are somewhat shorter at flowering than those of var. giganteum, and that the bracts of var. chloropetalum show a slightly metallic luster at that stage of development.</discussion></treatment>
