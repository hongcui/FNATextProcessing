  <description type="morphology">Bulbs ± ovoid, 3.6–7.5 × 2–5.2 cm, 0.9–2.4(–2.7) times taller than long; scales
        unsegmented, longest 3.1–6.4 cm; stem roots absent. Stems to 2.1 m. Buds rounded in cross
        section. Leaves in 2–7 whorls or partial whorls (scattered and ± proximal in dry, exposed
        sites), 3–22(–40) leaves per whorl, drooping at tips to ascending, 6–16 × 0.9–4.4 cm,
        2.6–8.5 times longer than wide; blade elliptic, usually narrowly so, often weakly
        oblanceolate, rarely obovate, margins undulate or not, apex acute; veins and margins ±
        smooth abaxially. Inflorescences racemose, 1–27-flowered. Flowers pendent, fragrant;
        perianth Turk’s-cap-shaped; sepals and petals reflexed 1/3 along length from base, pink,
        less often white, and if so usually aging pink, usually with copious maroon spots and
        proximal median longitudinal yellow stripe extending from basal nectaries, not distinctly
        clawed; sepals darker pink abaxially and usually distally, not ridged abaxially, 3.4–7.2 ×
        0.9–1.7 cm; petals 3.2–7.1 × 0.9–1.9 cm; stamens moderately exserted; filaments ± widely
        spreading, diverging 10°–22° from axis; anthers pale red-orange or magenta, 0.5–1.4 cm;
        pollen orange; pistil 2.9–4.2 cm; ovary 1.5–3 cm; style green, often pale; pedicel 8.8–23.8
        cm. Capsules 2.9–5.7 × 1–1.6 cm, 2.2–3.7 times longer than wide. Seeds 177–309. 2n =
        24.</description>

  <discussion>Kellogg’s lily occurs from Humboldt County, California, north to just over the
        Oregon border. Like Lilium bolanderi and L. pardalinum subspp. vollmeri and wigginsii, it is
        endemic to the Klamath Mountains.</discussion>
  <discussion>Occasionally plants occur with one or more whorls coalesced into tufts with as many
        as 40 leaves. Plants in open chaparral are usually of small stature with compact
        inflorescences and the ascending leaves are undulate on the margins. Plants of forest gaps
        are larger, with open inflorescences and flat, horizontal leaves.</discussion>
  <discussion>Lilium kelloggii is pollinated by pale swallowtail butterflies (Papilio eurymedon
        Lucas, family Papilionidae) and western tiger swallowtails (P. rutulus Lucas).</discussion>
