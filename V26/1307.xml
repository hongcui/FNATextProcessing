  <description>Stems ± strongly thickened, base not bulbous. Inflorescences: racemes dense to lax,
    10–65 × 1.5–6.5 cm. Flowers 6–41, conspicuous; perianth open; sepals directed forward to
    somewhat spreading, brown, tan, red, or yellow, often darker distally, lanceolate, 3-veined,
    4.7–15 mm; petals frequently curved toward column, nearly adhering to it, tan to yellowish,
    often red distally, usually spotted with purple, lanceolate to oblanceolate, 4.5–11.5 mm; lip
    white, usually spotted with purple, obovate to elliptic, thin, lateral lobes 2, rounded, middle
    lobe oblong to broadly dilated toward apex, with 2 distinct basal lamellae, 4–9 × 1.5–6 mm;
    column whitish yellow, spotted with purple, usually curved, 3.3–7.8 mm, basally with ridges or
    poorly developed auricles; ovary 5–14 mm; mentum obscure, adnate to edge of ovary. Capsules
    pendulous, ellipsoid, 9–24 × 5–9 mm. 2n = 42.</description>
  <discussion>several color forms exist in corallorhiza maculata, often occurring in proximity and
    sometimes forming large clumps. white-flowered southern plants have occasionally been
    misidentified as corallorhiza trifida. dance-flies (empis).have been reported as pollinators (j.
    l. kipping 1971)</discussion>
