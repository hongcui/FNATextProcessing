The species may be an ancient cultivar, possibly derived from A. sisalana or A. kewensis Jacobi. The plant reproduces only by vegetative means; capsules and seeds have never been seen. H. S. Gentry (1982) indicated that the plant produces a fine but weak fiber. In Mexico it is grown only as an ornamental.</discussion></treatment>
