  <discussion>Dasylirion texanum is often small, but can become quite large in moist situations. It is relatively homogeneous in the northeastern portion of its range in east-central Texas. In west Texas, plants are larger and have both antrorse and retrorse prickles. These have been included in D. heteracanthum I. M. Johnston, but they are probably hybrids between D. texanum and D. leiophyllum, in which the prickles are retrorse. There is little mixing of these two species except in a narrow zone extending northward through the Chisos, Davis, and Guadalupe mountains in west Texas.</discussion>
