Recent evidence suggests that this species is not closely related to Muilla, but rather to Bloomeria and Triteleia, and probably should be placed in a separate, monotypic genus (J. C. Pires 2000). Previous taxonomic keys have focused on the shape of the dilated filament bases, but the orientation of the stamens and the unfused filament bases are more reliably diagnostic.</discussion><discussion>The species is in cultivation, and the corms were probably eaten by native Americans.</discussion></treatment>
