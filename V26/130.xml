  <description type="morphology">Rhizomes horizontal, brownish, thick, praemorse, not brittle. Scapes often 2 from
        single terminal bud, round in cross section, 2.5–5.5 dm, stout, glabrous. Bracts held well
        above ground, sessile; blade bright green (in early anthesis rather succulent in
        appearance), usually well-marked with lighter and darker green spots, occasionally obscurely
        or scarcely mottled, mottling becoming obscure with age, ovate to broadly ovate, 11–18 ×
        12–17 cm, somewhat glossy, apex acuminate. Flower odor spicy in fresh flowers, becoming
        fetid in older flowers; sepals displayed above bracts, spreading, divergent, green,
        purple-streaked, lanceolate, 40–75 × 10–14 mm, margins entire, apex acute to round-acute;
        petals long-lasting, conspicuous, spreading-erect to erect, tips incurving slightly, ±
        connivent, partially to completely concealing stamens and ovary, glossy dark maroon-red or
        purple, not spirally twisted, flat, oblanceolate, 5.5–11 × 2–3.5 cm, widest at or below
        middle, glossy, thick-textured, cuneate basally, margins ± flat, entire, apex round-acute;
        stamens erect, straight, 15–26 mm, slightly concealing ovary; filaments dark purple, 2–4 mm;
        anthers dark maroon, 13–24 mm, dehiscence introrse; connectives straight, barely extended
        beyond anther sacs; ovary inconspicuous, purple, ovoid, round to 6-angled, 8–15 mm; stigmas
        erect, distinct, subulate, 6–8 mm, fleshy, thickened basally. Fruits dark reddish purple,
        ovoid to ellipsoid or weakly angled, 20–50 mm, fleshy.</description>
