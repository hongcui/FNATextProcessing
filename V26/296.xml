It was commonly used as food by Native Americans. The small bulbs were often eaten raw, and the larger ones were either dried or cooked in various ways. The Okanogan-Colville tribe used the appearance of F. pudica flowers as a sign that spring had arrived, and the Shuswap tribe used them in bouquets.</discussion></treatment>
