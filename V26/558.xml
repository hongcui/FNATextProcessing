  <discussion>Hymenocallis puntagordensis is one of the most poorly known spider-lilies (G. L. Smith et al. 1994; G. L. Smith and M. A. Garland 1996). Apparently it occurs only in the vicinity of Punta Gorda. It was known only from the type collection until collections were made in 1993 (G. L. Smith &amp; M. A. Garland 1625) and 1995 (G. L. Smith &amp; M. A. Garland 1664–1668).</discussion>
  <discussion>This species has been designated in the horticultural trade as narrow-leaved Hymenocallis latifolia, but it is easily distinguished from H. latifolia by its highly coriaceous, suberect, narrowly liguliform leaves and its small staminal corona with prominently lacerate margin.</discussion>
