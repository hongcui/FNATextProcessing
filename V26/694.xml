Flowers: perianth yellow or white, often tinged or fading blue, 18–26 mm, tube slenderly funnelform, moderately attenuate at base, 6–10 mm, lobes widely spreading, with conspicuous dark purple midvein, 12–16 mm, ca. twice as long as tube; stamens attached at 1 level, nearly equal; filaments narrowly subulate, 3–4 mm, apical appendages absent; anthers blue or sometimes white, 1.5–2 mm; ovary 1/2 as long as stipe; pedicel 1.5–4 cm. 2n = 32.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><habitat>dry slopes</habitat><elevation>100–3000 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Oreg.</us_distribution><discussion>Triteleia hendersonii is common within its restricted range. The plants previously recognized as var. leachiae, or separately as T. leachiae, differ primarily in having a white perianth and are limited to Curry County, Oregon. Intermediates have been found, and further study of this variation is required to determine whether formal recognition of infraspecific taxa is warranted.</discussion></treatment>
