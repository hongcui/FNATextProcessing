  <discussion>Hymenocallis choctawensis is not well known (G. L. Smith et al. 1991). It is most abundant along the stream banks and swamp forests of the central and western Florida panhandle. It has great horticultural potential due to its large, oblanceolate, shiny green leaves and showy inflorescences that may have up to but rarely more than eight flowers. The long, spreading tepals and the funnelform staminal corona that gradually spreads in time are especially distinctive (G. L. Smith and N. C. Coile 1999; G. L. Smith and M. A. Garland 1996).</discussion>
  <discussion>Most herbarium specimens of Hymenocallis choctawensis encountered in this study have been misidentified as either H. caroliniana or H. occidentalis. It is readily distinguished from H. occidentalis on herbarium sheets by its rhizomatous bulb and triangular bracts that are not long-tapering.</discussion>
