  <discussion>Iris tridentata is quite different from the other two species of ser. Tripetalae
        that occur in the flora. The rhizome has been described by W. R. Dykes (1913) as “almost
        stoloniferous,” by J. K. Small (1933), “the cord-like rootstocks are peculiar,” and by R. K.
        Godfrey and J. W. Wooton (1979), “clothed with coarse, strongly many-ribbed, brown,
        overlapping scales.” The brown scalelike leaves are produced very close together and are
        long enough that they appear as a small fan; as the internodes elongate, the scales are
        pulled apart but still overlap along the rhizome. Roots are produced from the lower side of
        the rhizome at the nodes. Branches may appear at any node along the narrow portion of the
        rhizome rather than just from the broader apex.</discussion>
