Capsules ca. 10 mm, lightly papillose. Seeds ca. 2 mm diam.</description><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><habitat>roadsides</habitat><habitat>abandoned gardens</habitat><habitat>grassy slopes</habitat><elevation>50 m;</elevation><introduced>introduced;</introduced><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><global_distribution>South Africa.</global_distribution><discussion>Freesia alba often has been confused with F. refracta in older literature, and consequently the latter has been erroneously listed in regional floras in North America. Freesia refracta is rarely cultivated; F. alba and cultivars derived from crosses between it and other species are widely grown, as both ornamentals and cut flowers.</discussion></treatment>
