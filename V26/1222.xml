    <description>Plants 15–50(–67) cm. Corms globose to elongate, rarely forked, 11–26 mm. Leaves
        not appressed to inflorescence at flowering; blade linear, 7–23 cm × 2–6 mm. Inflorescences
        green or slightly purple at base, becoming entirely green after flowering, 20–62 cm; floral
        bracts ovate to ovate-lanceolate, 1.5–4.5 mm. Flowers 3–20, more than 1 cm apart, opening
        sequentially, magenta, pale pink, or white, faintly fragrant; dorsal sepal oblanceolate,
        12–20 × 4.5–6 mm; lateral sepals widely spreading (reflexed), ovate to lanceolate, falcate,
        10–15 × 5–9 mm, apex acuminate; petals lanceolate to weakly pandurate, falcate, 9–18 × 3–5.5
        mm, apex acuminate; lip 9–13 mm, middle lobe with dilated apex triangular, 5–11 mm wide,
        apex truncate, retuse to apiculate; column 7–11 × 1–1.5 mm, distal end 6–9 mm wide;
        rostellum present. Capsules ellipsoid to obconic, 11–23 × 4–8 mm. 2n = 40, 42.</description>

    <discussion>Specimens of plants from western Louisiana reported as Calopogon pallidus (A. M.
        Pridgeon and L. E. Urbatsch 1977) are actually C. oklahomensis.</discussion>
    <discussion>Natural hybrids of Calopogon multiflorus and C. pallidus have been observed in
        central Florida, and collections of other such hybrids are known from peninsular Florida (D.
        H. Goldman 2000; D. H. Goldman and L. S. Orzell 2000).</discussion>
    <discussion>Calopogon pallidus is distinguished by its relatively widely spaced flowers in a
        long spike, one to three flowers opening simulataneously, lateral sepals typically falcate
        and reflexed, and petals entire to barely obpandurate and falcate. The blooming period is
        longer, and C. pallidus flowers later than all species of Calopogon, with the exception of
        C. tuberosus.</discussion>
