Leaves persistent, green at anthesis, 2–3, sheathing proximal 1/3–1/2 scape; blade solid, flat, narrowly lanceolate to broadly elliptic, 10–20 cm × 15–90 mm, base evidently petiolate, margins entire; petiole 1–20 cm. Scape persistent, solitary, erect, terete distally, 2-edged proximally, 30–70 cm × 2–3 mm. Umbel persistent, erect, loose, 20–35-flowered, hemispheric, bulbels unknown; spathe bracts persistent, 1–2, 3–6-veined, lanceolate to ovate, ± equal, apex obtuse, nearly beakless. Flowers stellate, 4–5 mm; tepals spreading, white or greenish white, outer lanceolate, inner narrowly ovate, ± equal, reflexed in age, withering in fruit, margins entire, apex acute or obtuse; stamens exserted; anthers yellow; pollen yellow; ovary crestless; style exserted, linear, equaling stamens or longer; stigma capitate, scarcely thickened; pedicel 10–30 mm.

Within this species, various subspecies and varieties have been described, but, as circumscribed, they are not clearly distinct. The North American plants have been known as subsp. platyphyllum, but until the variation within this widespread species can be worked out along natural lines, recognition of infraspecific taxa seems pointless.</discussion></treatment>
