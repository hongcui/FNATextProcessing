  <discussion>Hymenocallis crassifolia was described from a collection made near St. Mary, Georgia, by Herbert. The type specimen appears to have been lost for some time. However, collections that have been made from the nearby Satilla River fit the description well, as do other collections made from wetlands in the outer Coastal Plain of the Carolinas.</discussion>
  <discussion>This species is distinguished in the field by coriaceous, liguliform leaves that are nearly erect throughout their length. The staminal corona is funnelform but gradually spreads with age, and the margin of the cup has small, irregular dentations.</discussion>
  <discussion>Hymenocallis crassifolia is difficult to distinguish on herbarium sheets from the closely allied H. duvalensis. They are separated by distribution and habitat, and it is sometimes apparent on the herbarium sheets that H. crassifolia tends to have a more slender perianth tube, smaller funnelform corona, bracts that are not noticeably long-acuminate, and often a less elongated bulb neck.</discussion>
