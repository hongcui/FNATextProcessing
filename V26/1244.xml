  <discussion>Epidendrum acunae, described from Cuba, was discovered in Florida in 1962, as a single population, and it has apparently become extirpated because of overcollecting (R. Sauleda, pers. comm.). Only one specimen from Florida has been found (Sauleda 942, FTG), of which a photograph of the live flower is at AMO, apart from the record in C. A. Luer (1972). The description has been prepared from Luer and from Cuban and Mexican material.</discussion>
