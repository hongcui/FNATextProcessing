    <description>Plants (50–)70–120(–150) cm. Corms tunicate, (15–)20–30 mm diam.; tunic layered,
        brown, brittle, cartilaginous, outer layer becoming irregularly broken to fibrous, usually
        bearing numerous tiny cormlets basally. Stems simple. Leaves contemporary with flowering
        stem [foliage leaves borne later on separate shoots], 4–6(–7), at least proximalmost 2 ±
        basal, distalmost 1–2 cauline, ± sheathing, ± 1/2 length of spike; blade narrowly lanceolate
        to ± linear, (5–)10–20(–30) mm wide, midribs and margins notably thickened. Spikes
        (2–)3–7(–14)-flowered, secund; sheaths subequal, (2.5–)4–7 cm, inner slightly shorter than
        outer, apex sometimes dry, pale. Flowers unscented; perianth tube ± cylindrical, curving
        outward in distal 1/2, (25–)35–45 mm; tepals red to orange with yellow mark on outer 3
        tepals (or yellow to greenish and often with red to brown streaks on inner tepals), unequal,
        inner 3 tepals broadly elliptic, dorsal tepal horizontal to downcurved, 35–50 mm, to 22–30
        mm wide, inner lateral tepals usually curving outward distally, ± equaling dorsal, outer 3
        tepals curving downward, 20–25(–30) mm, outermost tepal somewhat longer and narrower than
        outer lateral tepals; filaments ca. 25 mm; anthers 12–16 mm; style branching near apex of
        anthers; branches (4–)5–6 mm. Capsules ellipsoid to ovoid, (18–)25–35 × 12–14 mm. Seeds
        broadly winged, 8–12 × 5–9 mm; seed coats light brown, glossy.</description>
