Stems erect to spreading, reddish tan, becoming darker, branched, short-stipitate-glandular, usually resinous. Leaves ascending to spreading; blades elliptic to narrowly oblanceolate (flat or somewhat concave adaxially), 10–35 × 2–5 mm, midnerves evident (often with 1–2 fainter, collateral veins), apices acute, apiculate, faces short-stipitate-glandular, usually gland-dotted; axillary fascicles absent. Heads in cymiform arrays (to 4 cm wide). Peduncles 1–10 mm (bracts 1–5, resembling phyllaries, stipitate-glandular). Involucres obconic, 5.5–7.5 × 2.5–4 mm. Phyllaries 30–40 in 4–5 series, tan, lanceolate to elliptic, 2–7 × 0.5–1.2 mm, strongly unequal, mostly chartaceous (bodies abruptly constricted at bases of appendages), midnerves faint, (margins membranous, sparsely ciliate apically), apices (usually recurved) usually acute to cuspidate, sometimes long-acuminate, abaxial faces glabrate, often gland-dotted. Ray florets 1–8; laminae elliptic, 3–4 × 0.8–1.3 mm. Disc florets 5–15; corollas 5–7 mm. Cypselae usually tan, sometimes reddish, narrowly obconic, 4–5.5 mm, glabrous or densely sericeous; pappi whitish tan, 4–5.5 mm.</description><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><phenology>nov</phenology><habitat>rock faces</habitat><habitat>cracks</habitat><habitat>and crevices and stony soils</habitat><habitat>usually on limestone</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>ca. 2100 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><discussion>Ericameria arizonica grows in the Grand Canyon.</discussion></treatment>
