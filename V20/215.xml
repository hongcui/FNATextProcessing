Stems 1–10+, erect (usually simple), rough-puberulent or shortly spreading hirsute, or proximally glabrate. Leaves: basal petioles 1.5–7 mm, blades spatulate to lanceolate or subrhombic, mostly 50–109 × 15–40 mm, bases tapering, glabrous, margins sharply serrate, ciliate, apices acuminate; mid and distal sessile, blades lanceolate to subrhombic, much reduced distally, margins serrulate becoming entire distally, glabrous. Heads 15–50+ in compactly rounded corymbiform arrays, becoming paniculiform in robust plants. Peduncles 1–7, short-strigose; bracts leaflike, 5–15 mm. Involucres campanulate, 5–6 mm. Phyllaries (in 3–4 series) lanceolate, unequal (midnerves swollen), acute to acuminate (tips dark green). Ray florets 8–10(–15); laminae 2–3.5 mm. Disc florets 20–60; corollas 3.5–4.5 mm, lobes 1.5–2 mm. Cypselae 2–3 mm, sparsely strigose to glabrate; pappi (of 12–22 bristles) about 3 mm. 2n = 54.</description><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><habitat>rock crevices of exposed outcrops</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>1600–2000 m;</elevation><us_distribution>N.C.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Tenn.</us_distribution><discussion>Solidago spithamaea is listed as threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
