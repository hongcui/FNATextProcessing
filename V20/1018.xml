Leaf blades narrowly oblong to narrowly oblanceolate, 20–50 mm, margins shallowly to deeply pinnatifid (lobes in 3–8 evenly arranged pairs, apically aristate). Involucres 7–8 × 5–7.5 mm. Phyllary apices green to greenish yellow, not aristate, sparsely to prominently gland-dotted, without resin pockets. Florets 18–25; corollas 5–6 mm. Cypsela ribs not forming apical hornlike extensions.</description><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><habitat>slopes</habitat><habitat>river edges</habitat><habitat>sandy to clay soils</habitat><habitat>gypseous or saline, badlands in pinyon-juniper woodlands</habitat><habitat>commonly with atriplex</habitat><elevation>1500–1800 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution>N.Mex.</us_distribution><discussion>Isocoma azteca is similar to I. rusbyi in most features and perhaps most closely related to it; the pinnate leaves of I. azteca are distinctive. The two taxa are essentially contiguous in range along the New Mexico-Arizona border and their interaction in natural populations needs to be studied.</discussion></treatment>
