The report of the subspecies from southern Bay County (J. C. Semple 1981) was based on a few plants that were subsequently determined to be a hybrid swarm involving subsp. linearifolia and another species. This subspecies might deserve species status and more investigation is warranted. Plants of subsp. dressii could be confused with sparsely hairy forms of Chrysopsis subulata, which differ in having twisted, subulate phyllaries.</discussion></treatment>
