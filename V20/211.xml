    <description>Leaves: basal (rosettes) usually withering by flowering; petiole bases or
        vasculature not persisting on rhizomes; proximalmost cauline petiolate, sometimes present at
        flowering; proximal and distal sometimes 3-nerved. Heads in ± paniculiform or thyrsiform
        arrays (wand-, club-, or secund cone-shaped) or in axillary clusters, sometimes in rounded
        corymbiform arrays. Phyllaries 1-nerved, usually not striate (3–5-nerved and striate in S.
        glomerata, S. lancifolia, S. roanensis) sometimes minutely stipitate-glandular, sometimes
        resinous. Pappus bristles in 2–3 series (shorter, outer setiform scales rarely present,
        outer, longer bristles apically attenuate, inner bristles longest, weakly to strongly
        clavate).</description>
