  <discussion>Chrysopsis lanuginosa is found in Bay, Calhoun, Escambia, Gadsden, Liberty, Okaloosa, Walton, and Washington counties. The common name reflects the location of the original collection. The species was very rare until slash pine plantations were developed in the central panhandle in the latter half of the twentieth century. The range has expanded from Bay County to ten counties as a result of human activities; this is contrary to what has happened during the same period for other species of the genus in Florida. A hybrid swarm involving C. lanuginosa and C. linearifolia has been observed at a highly disturbed site in southern Bay County.</discussion>
