Heads 1. Involucres 6–8 × 9–13 mm. Phyllaries in 2–3 series (commonly purplish or purple at tips), sparsely villous (hairs often becoming tawny, without purple cross walls), minutely glandular. Ray florets 50–60; corollas white to pink or purplish, 4–5(–6) mm, laminae (filiform, ca. 0.5–0.8 mm wide, involute) erect, not coiling or reflexing. Disc corollas 3.5–5 mm.
