Herbage floccose-tomentose, unevenly glabrescent (persistently hairy on abaxial leaf faces). Stems usually single, sometimes loosely clustered. Leaves ± evenly distributed (basal and proximal sometimes withering before flowering); petiolate (proximal) or sessile; blades ovoid or oblong to spatulate (usually pinnatifid to pinnatisect, lobes ± lanceolate to linear), (3–)5–12 × (1.5–)2–4 cm, bases tapered to ± truncate, ultimate margins (often revolute) dentate or entire. Heads 20–60 in corymbiform arrays. Calyculi of 4–6(–10) bractlets (lengths to 1/2 phyllaries). Phyllaries ± 13, 5–7 mm, tips green or greenish. Ray florets ± 13; corolla laminae 12–15 mm. Cypselae hairy.</description><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>waste grounds</habitat><elevation>0–200+ m;</elevation><introduced>introduced;</introduced><us_distribution>Pa.</us_distribution><global_distribution>Old World.</global_distribution><discussion>Senecio erucifolius has been introduced occasionally around seaports and has persisted.
