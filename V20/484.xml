These plants can be strikingly tall for the genus. Usually the array is compact; it may extend down the stem and be paniculiform in robust, late season plants. The basal rosettes can have a mixture of outer woolly, oblanceolate and inner glabrous, linear leaves. Small, depauperate plants of subsp. linearifolia could be confused with linear-leaved forms of Chrysopsis gossypina subsp. hyssopifolia, which differ in having ciliate leaf margins. Hybrids with C. lanuginosa occur in southern Bay County.</discussion></treatment>
