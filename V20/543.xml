  <discussion>Heterotheca zionensis grows in eastern Arizona and Utah; it is introduced and established in the vicinity of Las Cruces, New Mexico; chance introductions (likely emphemeral) have been found in Moffat County, Colorado, and Franklin County, Idaho. Whitish-appearing stems and leaves readily distinguish H. zionensis from H. villosa var. scabra, which frequently occurs sympatrically in southern Utah and northern Arizona. The species could be confused also with H. villosa var. pedunculata which has more hairs/mm2 on its leaves and few or no glands on its phyllaries. It could also be confused with narrow, smaller-leaved forms of H. fulcrata var. amplifolia, which has a few petiolate-ovate bracts subtending the heads.</discussion>
