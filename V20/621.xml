  <discussion>Erigeron parryi mostly has been included within the concept of E. ochroleucus, but two studies (P. Lesica 2005; G. L. Nesom 2004e) independently have confirmed its reality as an endemic of southwestern Montana and adjacent Wyoming. Leaves of E. parryi are equally hairy (usually hirsuto-strigose) on both faces, contrasted with the reduced vestiture (loosely strigose) only on adaxial leaf faces of E. ochroleucus, and the involucral vestiture is of hairs often with purplish cross walls. Also, E. parryi produces branched caudices and smaller heads with fewer rays. Lesica also noted as distinctive the caudex branches thickened by the presence of old leaf bases proximal to the current leaves.</discussion>
