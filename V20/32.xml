Stems erect, slender, rounded, smooth, glabrous or stipitate-glandular proximal to heads. Leaves often withering and sparse by flowering; sessile; blades (1-nerved) filiform to linear-oblanceolate, 10–30 × 1–3 mm (slightly fleshy), bases narrowed, margins entire (revolute), apices acute (mucronate), faces glabrous, gland-dotted. Heads borne singly or in (pedunculate clusters) in loose paniculiform or racemiform arrays. Involucres funnelform; staminate 3–5 mm, pistillate 3–5 mm. Phyllaries lanceolate (not keeled), 1–4 mm, margins ciliate, chartaceous, apices acute to acuminate (abaxial faces scurfy-glandular). Staminate florets 15–22; corollas 4 mm. Pistillate florets ca. 25; corollas 2.5 mm. Cypselae 2–3 mm, 10-nerved, glabrous or ciliate along nerves; pappi 7–10 mm. 2n = 18.</description><phenology>oct</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><habitat>chaparral</habitat><habitat>torrey-pine forests</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>60–300 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><discussion>Baccharis vanessae is highly localized in chaparral remnants in relictual Torrey Pine forests of coastal San Diego County.
