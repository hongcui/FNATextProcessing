  <discussion>Heterotheca marginata grows in the Superstition and Pinal mountains. It is characterized by its numerous, long, hispido-strigose hairs along the entire margins of its distal leaves and peduncle bracts. The hairs give the plants a light gray-green appearance from a distance. The leaves are stiff, unlike other taxa in the section. It is similar to H. fulcrata var. arizonica, which is more glandular and typically has narrowly ovate to lanceolate bracts subtending smaller heads, and H. fulcrata var. senilis, which can be similar in indument but typically has more ovate leaves and heads subtended by narrowly ovate to lanceolate bracts.</discussion>
