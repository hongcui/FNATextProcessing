Harms</subspecies_authority></TaxonIdentification><description>Perennials or subshrubs, 30–70 cm; fibrous-rooted or rhizomatous (new rosettes from bases of old shoots, additional rosettes at ends of short lateral rhizomes or roots). Stems erect or ascending, sometimes branched, densely short-woolly. Leaves: basal blades spatulate to oblanceolate, 40–100 × 15–25 mm, margins entire or apically dentate, faces densely short-woolly; cauline blades obovate to oblanceolate, gradually or hardly reduced distally, bases cuneate to slightly auriculate-clasping, margins entire, sometimes undulate, cilia rarely more than 1 mm, apices mucronulate, faces densely appressed-tomentose, sparsely stipitate-glandular (glands hidden by hair). Heads 1–25+ in subumbelliform to paniculiform arrays (proximal branches sometimes also flowering). Peduncles 1–4 cm, densely stipitate-glandular; bracteoles 0–4, lineaer to oblanceolate, proximally woolly, stipitate-glandular distally. Involucres (yellow-green in bud) campanulate, 5–8 mm. Phyllaries in 3–4 series, erect, linear, unequal, 0.6–1 mm wide, apices sharply acute or acuminate to aristate, faces stipitate-glandular. Ray florets 15–20; laminae 6–8 × 1.5–2.5 mm. Disc florets 25–35; corollas 6–7 mm, lobes 0.5 mm. Cypselae 2–2.5 mm, without ridges, smooth or faintly ribbed, moderately strigose; pappi in 3 series, outer of linear scales 0.5–1 mm, inner of 25–30 bristles 5–6 mm, inner weakly clavate. 2n = 10.</description><phenology>mid</phenology><phenology>late fall</phenology><habitat>sand pine–evergreen oak scrub</habitat><habitat>very well drained, fine, white sands</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>0–30 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Fla.</us_distribution><discussion>Chrysopsis floridana is found in Hardee, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Pinellas counties.
