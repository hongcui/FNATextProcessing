Long</variety_authority></TaxonIdentification><description>Biennials, 20–70 cm; taprooted (frequently perennating by rosettes produced at bases of old stems and at ends of short lateral rhizomes and roots). Stems 1–5+, erect (sometimes purple-tinged), often much branched proximally, glabrous to sparsely pilose, eglandular. Leaves: basal blades oblanceolate to linear-oblanceolate, (first season leaves) 50–100 × 4–10 mm, faces densely woolly; cauline blades linear-lanceolate to linear, reduced distally, bases tapering to rounded, margins entire, long-piloso-ciliate, often undulate, apices acute, often twisted, faces sparsely pilose. Heads 10–70 in lax corymbiform arrays. Peduncles 1–10 cm (thin), glabrous or glabrate; bracteoles linear-lanceolate (margins ciliate), glabrous or sparsely pilose, sometimes sparsely stipitate-glandular. Involucres campanulate, 8–10 mm. Phyllaries in 4–5 series, linear, 0.6–0.9 mm wide, unequal, apices long-attenuate, rarely acute (some n Florida collections), tips spreading to reflexed, twisted, faces proximally glabrous or sparsely stipitate-glandular. Ray florets 10–28; laminae 5–8(–10) × 1.5–2 mm. Disc florets 30–45; corollas 5–6 mm, lobes ca. 0.5 mm. Cypselae 1.5–2 mm, 6–10-ridged (ridges yellow to dark red-brown, translucent, clavate), weakly ribbed, faces glabrate to sparsely strigose proximally; pappi in 3 series, outer of linear to linear-triangular scales 0.4–1 mm, inner of 20–25 bristles 6–7 mm, inner moderately clavate. 2n = 10.</description><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><habitat>sandy open grounds</habitat><habitat>pine and oak scrub</habitat><elevation>10–50 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Fla.</us_distribution><discussion>Chrysopsis subulata is found on the central to northern peninsula. Early blooming plants may have a second blooming flush in October to December with flowering heads on otherwise brown and dried stems or from short new shoots developing from lower nodes.</discussion><discussion>Plants of Chrysopsis subulata from Alachua County have acute phyllaries rather than long-attenuate and reflexed, but the leaves have long-pilose margins typical of the species. The number of ridges on the cypselae varies from a few red-brown as in C. linearifolia subsp. dressii to covering nearly the entire body.</discussion></treatment>
