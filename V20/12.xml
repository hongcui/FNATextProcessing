Stems erect, green, striate-angled, glabrous or slightly scurfy. Leaves present at flowering; short-petiolate; blades (1-nerved, lateral veins obscure) obovate to spatulate, 10–30 × 7–18 mm (somewhat fleshy), margins entire or occasionally with 1–2 short, broad teeth per side, bases tapering, apices broadly obtuse, submucronate or slightly retuse, faces glabrous, gland-dotted, sometimes resinous. Heads (in terminal clusters) in (leafy) corymbiform or paniculiform arrays. Involucres obconic; staminate 3–4 mm, pistillate 5–7 mm. Phyllaries ovate to lanceolate, 1–4 mm, margins scarious-erose, medians green, apices obtuse to acuminate. Staminate florets 20–30; corollas 3–4 mm. Pistillate florets 20–30; corollas 4–5 mm. Cypselae 1–2 mm, 8–10-nerved, glabrous; pappi 3–5 mm (scarcely elongating in fruit).</description><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><phenology>nov</phenology><habitat>hammocks and dune hollows</habitat><habitat>mangroves</habitat><elevation>0–10 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Fla.</us_distribution><global_distribution>Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution>West Indies.</global_distribution><discussion>Baccharis dioica is known from the southern tip of Florida.
