  <discussion>Species 2 (2 in the flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>The relationships of Machaeranthera have long been unclear, and much disagreement has occurred about its circumscription. It has been included in Aster by some and maintained as a separate genus by others. In addition, all or parts of many other genera have been included in Machaeranthera by various authors, such as Xylorhiza, Dieteria, Arida, Xanthisma, Psilactis, and Rayjacksonia. Studies of chloroplast DNA and nuclear ribosomal DNA, in combination with chemical and cytological studies, do not support previous circumscriptions of Machaeranthera (D. R. Morgan and B. B. Simpson 1992; Morgan 1997, 2002). Those studies suggest that none of the other taxa are closest relatives of Machaeranthera, and they were treated as separate genera by Morgan and R. L. Hartman (2003).</discussion>
