  <description>Leaves: basal withering by flowering, proximalmost cauline sessile, withering by
    flowering, not as large as proximal and sometimes distal, 3-nerved (two lateral nerves
    prominent, sometimes obscurely so and only on proximal leaves). Heads in
    thyrsiform-paniculiform, usually congested cone-shaped (pyramidal), secund, sometimes leafy
    arrays (club-shaped in S. elongata), proximal branches often arching, secund, branches sometimes
    shorter than subtending leaves. Phyllaries not striate, sometimes stipitate-glandular. Pappus
    bristles usually in 2 series (sometimes similar, inner usually weakly, if at all clavate, rarely
    moderately so).</description>

  <discussion>Subsection Triplinerviae includes the Solidago canadensis complex, which fully
    deserves its reputation for being one of the more taxonomically challenging species assemblages
    in North America. All members have ± 3-nerved mid cauline leaves, although the trait is obscure
    in the narrow-leaved S. altiplanities, S. juliae, and S. tortifolia, and can be obscure in the
    broader-leaved S. lepida and S. shortii. As evidenced by the many combinations under most names,
    opinions on how to treat the complex have been numerous, some of them due to misapplication of
    the basionyms. A. Cronquist (1994 and earlier) placed many of the species in S. canadensis
    itself, separating out only the more glabrous taxa, but inconsistently not all of them. The
    admittedly radical classification followed below developed from work done to prepare this
    treatment. Stem pubescence (kind and distribution of hairs), glandularity, leaf features (width,
    serrations), and array features are emphasized in distinguishing species. The geographic
    distribution of diploid members of the complex were also critical in assessing which races
    belonged in which species. It is possible that at one point during glacial times, each of the
    diploid races was geographically isolated. Subsequent formation of tetraploid and hexaploid
    races from most of those resulted in range expansions into the territories of other races,
    allowing hybridization to occur, especially between polyploids. The result is what occurs today:
    a series of mostly geographically distinct diploids with overlapping polyploid ranges forming an
    apparent classic pillar complex. Either convergence or hybridization may be responsible for the
    current overlap in the ranges of morphologic traits that are relatively distinct at the diploid
    level.</discussion>
