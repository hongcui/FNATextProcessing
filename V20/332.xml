Stems 1–20, erect, finely scabroso-puberulent, sparsely so with age proximally, densely so distally. Leaves: basal and proximal cauline withering by flowering, subsessile, gradually tapering to short-winged petiole-like bases; mid and distal cauline sessile, blades linear-elliptic to linear-lanceolate, 40–90 × 4–5 mm, 3-nerved from base, midnerves prominent, margins entire, finely scabrous, apices attenuate-acute, faces finely, sparsely to moderately strigose, more so on main nerves, finer nerves translucent, faces sometimes shiny. Heads 25–350, in short to elongate, secund pani-culiform arrays, branches ascending or ascending and distally recurved, sometimes second, sometimes elongate. Peduncles 2–6 mm, finely strigose; bracteoles 1–10, often crowded, linear-lanceolate, 2–3 mm, grading into phyllaries. Involucres narrowly campanulate, 3.5–4 mm. Phyllaries in 3–4 series, linear-lanceolate, strongly unequal, margins hyaline, distally subulate-ciliate, apices acute, glabrous. Ray florets 4–5; laminae 1.5–2.5 × 0.5 mm. Disc florets 6–8, 3–3.5 mm, lobes 0.5 mm. Cypselae (narrowly obconic) 1.5–2.5 mm, sparsely strigillose; pappi 3 mm. 2n = 18.</description><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><habitat>mixed gypsum and shale soils</habitat><habitat>rocky slopes</habitat><habitat>escarpments</habitat><habitat>and ridges in high plains</habitat><elevation>400–1200 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Okla.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Tex.</us_distribution></treatment>
