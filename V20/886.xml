    <description>Annuals, perennials, or subshrubs, 3–80 cm; taprooted, sometimes with much branched
        caudices. Leaf blades entire, serrate, dentate, or pinnatifid to deeply 2-pinnatifid, teeth
        or lobes usually bristle-tipped, often markedly so. Heads radiate. Involucres broadly
        turbinate to depressed campanulate or hemispheric. Phyllaries in 4–8 series, appressed to
        squarrose, light green to stramineous, linear to narrowly oblong, 1–2 mm wide, unequal,
        proximally rigid, distal 1/5–1/2 with green patch or strip (sometimes blackish near apices),
        not markedly expanded, apices obtuse to acuminate, usually stiffly, often markedly
        bristle-tipped, faces usually hairy, often stipitate-glandular. Receptacles: pit borders
        laciniate, teeth or setae distinct or basally connate, 0.4–3 mm. Ray corollas yellow.
        Cypselae often dimorphic, ellipsoid to broadly obovoid, or obscurely and narrowly cordiform,
        ray obscurely 3-sided (usually rounded on abaxial edge, often asymmetric, slightly shorter),
        disc flattened laterally, 1.5–3.2 mm, walls thin, 6–16-ribbed, usually weak, sometimes
        prominent, faces glabrous to densely silky; pappi of white to tawny, slightly to moderately
        dorsiventrally, basally flattened bristles 3.5–6 mm, in 2–4 markedly unequal series, ray
        sometimes shorter. x = (2, 3,) 4.</description>
