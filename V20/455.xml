  <discussion>Species 1:</discussion>
  <discussion>Dichaetophora is characterized by its annual habit, oblanceolate leaves, small, white-rayed heads, and broadly scarious-margined phyllaries. The cypselae are primarily 2-awned and have glochidiate hairs (each apical cell abruptly reflexed, together forming a pronged structure) covering the faces and the winged margins. Dichaetophora is similar and apparently closely related to Astranthium; it has the same chromosome number (2n = 6) as northern species of Astranthium. D. S. Correll and M. C. Johnston (1970) commented that Astranthium integrifolium and Dichaetophora are separated by a “few technical differences in achene and pappus...” and “almost certainly... should be congeneric.” This may prove to be the case, but inclusion of the winged and awned cypselae of Dichaetophora would alter the morphologic integrity of Astranthium, and more definitive evidence is needed.</discussion>
