  <discussion>Species 2 (2 in the flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>Both species of Emex are on the United States federal noxious weed list. Emex australis appears to be a more serious threat to agriculture and livestock production than does E. spinosa, based on experience in other parts of the world. The former is a serious agricultural pest in southern Australia, where it was introduced in the 1830s. Emex spinosa also was introduced there, apparently in the mid-1900s. The two species were formerly geographically isolated, but hybrids between them have recently been reported in Australia (E. Putievsky et al. 1980). Hybrids exhibit irregular meiosis and high sterility when self-pollinated; backcrosses with either parent often yield viable seeds.</discussion>
