It is uncertain whether his collection came from southwestern Iron County, Utah, or from southeastern Lincoln County, Nevada. A single, sterile collection (Shultz &amp; Shultz 7109, BRY, GH) with dubious label data supposedly was found in Nevada, and a second collection from that state, made by A. Jerry Tiehm and sent to L. M. Schulz, apparently has been lost.</discussion></treatment>
