</etymology><author>Ronald L. Hartman</author><author>Richard K. Rabeler</author><description>Herbs, annual or winter annual. Taproots slender to ± stout, especially proximally. Stems spreading or ascending to erect, simple or branched, terete to somewhat angular. Leaves opposite but appearing whorled, as 8–15 per axillary cluster, 2 clusters per node, connate proximally by often-prominent ridge from which stipules arise, sessile; stipules 4 per node, white, ovate to triangular, margins entire but splitting variously with age, apex obtuse to acuminate; blade 1-veined, linear or filiform, sometimes succulent, apex blunt to apiculate. Inflorescences terminal, open to diffuse cymes; bracts paired, minute. Pedicels erect to ascending, spreading or usually reflexed and sometimes secund in fruit. Flowers usually bisexual, sometimes pistillate by stamen abortion; perianth and androecium briefly perigynous; hypanthium dish- or cup-shaped, not abruptly expanded distally; sepals distinct, silvery, elliptic to nearly ovate, 2.5–5 mm, herbaceous, margins scarious, apex acute to obtuse; petals 5, white, blade apex entire; nectaries at adaxial base of broader filaments opposite sepals; stamens 5 and opposite sepals, or 10 and arising from distally tapered rim of hypanthium; filaments distinct; styles 5, distinct, filiform, 0.4–0.6 mm, glabrous proximally; stigmas 5, linear along adaxial surface of styles, obscurely papillate (30×). Capsules ovoid, opening by 5 spreading to somewhat recurved valves; carpophore absent. Seeds 5–25, blackish, circular, subglobose or lenticular and laterally compressed, nearly smooth or finely papillate, membranous, entire marginal wing often present, appendage absent; embryo peripheral, annular to spirally curved. x = 9.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 5 (3 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><introduced>introduced;</introduced><global_distribution>Eurasia (esp.
