Stems erect to widely spreading, green or purple, 4–30 cm, stipitate-glandular distally, internodes of all stems 1–5 times as long as leaves. Leaves sometimes overlapping proximally, ± evenly spaced, connate proximally, with loose, scarious sheath 0.3–0.7 mm; blade straight to variously curved or coiled, green or purple, concave, 1–3 veined, linear, 5–40 × 0.2–0.4 mm, flexuous, margins not thickened, often scarious, sometimes ciliate or stipitate-glandular, apex green to purple, acute, navicular, dull, glabrous to stipitate-glandular; axillary leaves present proximally. Inflorescences 7–15+-flowered, open cymes; bracts subulate, scarious. Pedicels 0.2–4 cm, stipitate-glandular. Flowers: hypanthium disc-shaped; sepals 1(–3)-veined, midvein often more prominent than lateral veins, ± ovate (herbaceous portion lanceolate to oblong-lanceolate to narrowly ovate), 2.5–3.7 mm, not enlarging in fruit, apex often purple, obtuse to acute, not hooded, stipitate-glandular at least proximally; petals ovate, (1–)1.7–2.1 times as long as sepals, apex broadly rounded, entire or irregularly dentate. Capsules on stipe 0.3–0.5 mm, broadly ovoid, 4 mm, longer than sepals. Seeds reddish brown, winged, orbiculate with radicle not prolonged, compressed, 1.3–2 mm, tuberculate; tubercles low, elongate.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>sandy and rocky slopes in chaparral, oak or pine woodlands</habitat><elevation>100–1800 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Oreg.</us_distribution><discussion>The winglike margins on the seeds of Minuartia douglasii are unique among North American members of the genus; M. howellii and M. tenella, the other members of sect.
