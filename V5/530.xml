In the wild, it is known from northern Lassen and Modoc counties in California, northern Washoe County, Nevada, and south-central Lake County, Oregon. Also, a series of small, disjunct populations occurs in southern Baker County, Oregon. The name E. chrysops was misapplied to these plants by J. L. Reveal (1968b). The taxon is of “special concern” to the Bureau of Land Management in California, and is considered “sensitive” in Nevada.</discussion></treatment>
