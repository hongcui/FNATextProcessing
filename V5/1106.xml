Stems prostrate, creep-ing, usually with branches that form dense mats, glabrous. Leaves persistent; ocrea margins not ciliate; blade clavate to spatulate, (1.5–)2–8(–8.5) × 0.4–0.9 mm, base attenuate, margins not hyaline, apex obtuse, glabrous. Inflorescences 5–9(–13) mm; ocreola encircling rachis, only the base adnate to rachis, apex acute. Pedicels spreading in anthesis, spreading the reflexed in fruit, 0.7–1.9 mm, much longer than subtending ocreola. Flowers bisexual; outer tepals loosely appressed in anthesis, sometimes spreading in fruit, white, pink or yellow, often drying yellow, elliptic to oblong, 1.4–2.2 mm in anthesis, margins entire; inner tepals loosely appressed in anthesis and fruit, white, pink, or yellow, elliptic to suborbiculate, 1.7–2.5 mm in anthesis, margins entire; filaments dimorphic; anthers pink or yellow; styles and stigmas 0.4–0.9 mm in anthesis. Achenes mostly included, reddish brown, 3-gonous, 2.2–3.4 × 1.6–2.4 mm, dull to shiny, minutely roughened. 2n = 36.</description><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><phenology>nov</phenology><habitat>xeric, white sand in sand pine scrub</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>30–60 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Fla.</us_distribution><discussion>Polygonella myriophylla is restricted to 119 sand pine scrub sites in the Lake Wales, Lake Henry, and Winter Haven ridges of central peninsular Florida (S.
