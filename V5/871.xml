It continues northward into southern Oregon. In some places, it can even be abundant or infrequently rather weedy. It is difficult to distinguish from E. gracile in the southern part of its range and from E. vimineum in the northeastern portion. A collection from Crook County, Oregon, (Steward &amp; Steward 6199, KANU, IA, OKLA, PENN, UTC) seems to be this species rather than E. vimineum.</discussion></treatment>
