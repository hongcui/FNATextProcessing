  <discussion>Variety xanti is found in the Coast Ranges from western Merced, eastern Monterey, and San Benito counties south to the Transverse Ranges of northern Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, thence eastward along the northern foothills of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains to extreme southwestern San Bernardino County, and then northward through the Tehachapi Mountains of central and eastern Kern County onto the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, going as far north as Madera County. In 1935, a disjunct population was sampled near Benton Station in southern Mono County (Robinson &amp; Lindner 20, RSA) but it has not been recollected.</discussion>
