It is rare and infrequent. A collection made by William Gambel in the 1840s suggests that the variety once occurred at San Simeon in extreme northern San Luis Obispo County; it is not known whether this is a labeling error or an indication of past distribution. Monterey spineflower is federally listed as threatened.</discussion></treatment>
