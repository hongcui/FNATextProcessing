Peduncles erect, straight, slender, 0.5–2.5(–4) cm, glabrous. Involucres campanulate, 0.6–1.5 × 0.8–1.5 mm, glabrous; teeth 5, erect, 0.2–0.4 mm. Flowers 1–2.5 mm; perianth white with greenish or reddish midribs, rarely yellowish, becoming pink to rose, glabrous; tepals monomorphic, oblong to narrowly ovate; stamens included to exserted, 1–1.8 mm; filaments glabrous.

A series of disjunct populations occurs in Fremont and Las Animas counties in Colorado. The species can be weedy in appearance but usually is absent from areas of significant disturbance, unlike other annual wild buckwheats.</discussion></treatment>
