  <discussion>Variety versicolor occurs infrequently in scattered mountain ranges across southern Nevada (Clark, Eureka, Lincoln, Lyon, Nye, and White Pine counties) and into California (eastern Inyo and Mono counties), where it may be somewhat more common. It occasionally is difficult to distinguish, as it approaches both var. dichrocephalum and var. juniporinum in nearly all features except flower color, a trait that is distinctive and consistent in the field. Throughout its range, plants with both simple and branched inflorescences may be observed, the branched expression being the more common one. Variety versicolor is found infrequently in cultivation and ought to be more commonly used.</discussion>
