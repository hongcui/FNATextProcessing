Stems spreading, without persistent leaf bases, up to 1/5 height of plant; caudex stems compact; aerial flowering stems erect, slender, solid, not fistulose, 1–2 dm, glabrous. Leaves basal, 1 per node; petiole 0.05–0.1 cm, glabrous; blade linear, 1.5–6 × 0.05–0.1 cm, sparsely floccose and green abaxially, glabrous and green adaxially, margins revolute. Inflorescences narrowly cymose, 0.5–1.5 × 0.2–0.8 dm; branches dichotomous, glabrous; bracts 3, scalelike, elongate-triangular, 1–4.5 mm. Peduncles absent. Involucres 1 per node, turbinate, 2.5–4.5 × 1.5–2.5(–3) mm, glabrous; teeth 5, erect, 0.5–0.8 mm. Flowers (2–)2.5–4 mm; perianth pale or greenish yellow, rarely white, glabrous; tepals connate proximal 1/3–1/2, monomorphic, oblong; stamens exserted, 2.5–4 mm; filaments glabrous or minutely pubescent.

It is allied to E. ostlundii, but differs in its linear leaf blades, narrow, strict inflo-rescences with di- and trichotomous, U-shaped branches, and longer, pale yellow flowers. The leaf blades are threadlike and the narrowest of any species in the genus.</discussion></treatment>
