Leaves basal; petiole 1–3 cm; blade spatulate to ovate, 0.5–2 × 0.3–1.2(–1.5) cm, thinly pubescent to densely tomentose at least abaxially. Inflorescences mostly flat-topped, open to rather densely branched, greenish to reddish; bracts persistent, 2, usually leaflike at proximal nodes and similar to leaf blades, short-petiolate, oblong to ovate, 0.3–0.8 cm × 2–6 mm, becoming sessile, reduced and scalelike at distal nodes, linear, acicular, often acerose, 0.1–0.5 cm × 0.5–1 mm, awns straight, 0.5–1 mm. Involucres in open clusters with 1 at node of dichotomies, reddish, cylindric, not ventricose, 2.5–3 mm, corrugate, without scarious or membranous margins, thinly pubescent with slender curly hairs; teeth spreading, unequal, 0.4–1.2 mm with 3 longer ones more erect than 3 shorter and less-prominent ones; awns uncinate, 0.3–0.6 mm. Flowers exserted; perianth white to rose or red, usually with white lobes, cylindric, 3–3.5 mm, pubescent; tepals connate ca. 1/2 their length, monomorphic to slightly dimorphic, narrowly oblong to obovate, rounded apically, those of outer whorl usually slightly broader and longer than those of inner whorl; stamens 9, mostly included; filaments distinct, 2.5–3 mm, glabrous; anthers pink to red, oblong, 0.4–0.5 mm. Achenes brown, lenticular, 2.5–3 mm. 2n = 38.</description><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><habitat>gravelly or rocky places</habitat><habitat>serpentine outcrops</habitat><habitat>mixed grassland and chaparral communities</habitat><habitat>pine-oak woodlands</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>60–800 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><discussion>Chorizanthe breweri is found infrequently in the Coast Ranges of southwestern California.</discussion></treatment>
