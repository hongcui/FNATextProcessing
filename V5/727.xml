Aerial flowering stems 0.4–2 dm, thinly tomentose to floccose. Leaves: petiole 0.5–1.5 cm; blade elliptic, 0.7–2(–2.2) × 0.4–1(–1.2) cm, densely white-tomentose abaxially, sparsely floccose or glabrous and green adaxially. Inflorescences thinly tomentose; proximal bracts 4–6, lanceolate to narrowly elliptic, 1–2 × 0.25–0.6 cm, distal bracts semileaflike, midway along branch, linear to narrowly lanceolate, 0.7–1 × 0.1–0.25 cm. Involucres turbinate to turbinate-campanulate, 5–8 × 3–4 mm. Flowers 5–7 mm at anthesis, 6.5–9 mm in fruit; perianth cream, rarely yellow, becoming suffused with blush of pinkish red to maroon.

Technically, the three bracts along the “branchlet” terminate a branch, and a peduncle extends from the whorl of bracts to the base of the involucre.</discussion></treatment>
