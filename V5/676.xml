It occurs also just to the east in Teton County, Wyoming. A collection from extreme northeastern Elko County, Nevada (Morefield &amp; Price 5566, NESH, NY, RENO) with much shorter leaves and inflorescence branches is tentatively included. The variety forms large, spreading mats with largish leaves in rather loose rosettes. It is often found growing intermixed with E. heracleoides. Spreading sulphur flower is worthy of cultivation.</discussion></treatment>
