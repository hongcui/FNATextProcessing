        inflorescences, not glaucous. Stems prostrate and spreading, branched, rooting at some
        nodes, 20–60+ cm. Leaves opposite; stipules persistent, divided into 3–5 subulate to
        fili-form segments, 1–2 mm; petiole 2–15 mm; blade orbiculate to reniform, 0.5–2.5 cm × 5–25
        mm, base cordate to rounded, apex rounded to acute. Inflorescences axillary and terminal,
        mostly open, 5–15+-flowered cymes. Pedicels shorter to longer than subtending bracts at
        maturity. Flowers: sepals with weak veins arcing outward at midsection and ± confluent
        apically, lanceolate to ovate (herbaceous portion similar), 2–4(–5) mm, ± equal, apex acute
        to acuminate (herbaceous portion similar), not hooded, glabrous or with ± sessile glands;
        petals 2-fid for 3/4+ their total length, 2–3 mm, 1/2–2/3 times as long as sepals, lobes
        1-veined, vein unbranched, linear, trunk absent, base abruptly tapered, apex rounded to
        acute. Seeds dark reddish brown, snail-shell-shaped, 1–1.5 mm; tubercles prominent, rounded.
