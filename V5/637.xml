Stems spreading, without persistent leaf bases, up to 1/4 height of plant; caudex stems absent; aerial flowering stems erect, slender, solid, not fistulose, 0.1–0.3 dm, thinly tomentose. Leaves cauline, 1 per node or fasciculate; petiole 0.1–0.2 cm; blade narrowly elliptic, 0.5–0.8 × 0.1–0.25 cm, densely white-tomentose ab-axially, silky-tomentose adaxially, margins revolute. Inflorescences cymose, 0.5–1 × 0.5–1.5 cm; branches dichotomous, thinly tomentose; bracts 3, scalelike, narrowly elliptic, 1–3 mm. Peduncles slender, erect, 0.3–0.5 cm, thinly tomentose. Involucres 1 per node, campanulate, 2–3 × 2.5–3.5(–4) mm, thinly tomentose; lobes 6, reflexed, 1–1.5 mm. Flowers 3.5–6 mm; perianth white to yellowish white, with large reddish to maroon spots, glabrous; tepals connate proximally, dimorphic, those of the outer whorl fan-shaped, 2–4 × 2–4 mm, those of inner whorl oblanceolate, 3.5–6 × 1–2.5 mm; stamens slightly exserted, 2–3 mm; filaments pilose proximally.
