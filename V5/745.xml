Stems: caudex spreading; aerial flowering stems erect or nearly so, slender, solid, not fistulose, arising at nodes of caudex branches and at distal nodes of short, nonflowering aerial branches, (0.2–)0.5–1.2 dm, tomentose, with a whorl of 4–8 leaflike bracts ca. midlength, similar to leaf blades, 0.4–0.8 × 0.1–0.3 cm. Leaves in loose to congested basal rosettes; petiole 0.2–0.4 cm, thinly tomentose; blade oblanceolate to elliptic, 0.5–1 × (0.2–)0.4–0.6 cm, white- or grayish-tomentose abaxially, thinly tomentose to nearly glabrous and dull green adaxially. Inflorescences capitate, 0.7–1.5 cm wide; branches absent; bracts absent immediately below involucre. Involucres 1 per node, campanulate, (2.5–)4–5 × 4–6 mm; teeth 6–9, lobelike, strongly reflexed, (2–)3–5 mm. Flowers (4–)5–6 mm, including 1–1.3 mm stipelike base; perianth pale yellow, villous abaxially; tepals slightly dimorphic, those of outer whorl obtuse, 3–5 × 3–3.5 mm, those of inner whorl broadly oblanceolate, 5–6 × 2.5–3 mm; stamens exserted, 4–5 mm; filaments pilose proximally. Achenes light brown, 5–5.5 mm, glabrous except for sparsely pubescent beak.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><habitat>rocky outcrops</habitat><habitat>montane conifer woodlands</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>2300–2600 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><discussion>Eriogonum twisselmannii is a rare species of the southern Sierra Nevada and is known only from Slate Mountain and The Needles in Tulare County. It is worthy of being on a “watch” list of rare plants in California, but because of its remote location, it is not threatened.</discussion></treatment>
