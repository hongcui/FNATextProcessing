Its range extends from the Muddy River near Weiser Wash to the confluence with the Virgin River, and from Sandy Hollow Wash to Middle Point on the Colorado River. It is listed for protection by the state of Nevada and is considered a “sensitive” species by the Bureau of Land Management and the Nevada Heritage Program. In Arizona, it is a “special status species.”</discussion></treatment>
