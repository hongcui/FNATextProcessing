  <discussion>Eriogonum villiflorum is probably more common than now documented, the plants being inconspicuous and easily overlooked. It is known from Eureka, Lincoln, northeastern Nye, and White Pine counties in eastern Nevada, and from Beaver, Iron, Juab, Kane, Millard, Sanpete, and Tooele counties in western Utah. The Kane County type location is questionable, as it is well outside the known range of the species today. The sprawling flowering stems with large clusters of involucres and flowers are distinctive. The species is occasionally encountered in cultivation as a rock-garden plant.</discussion>
