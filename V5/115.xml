Stems erect, (3–)10–23 cm, moderately to densely stipitate-glandular. Leaves: basal leaves abundant, persistent; cauline leaves in 5–7 pairs, reduced distally; basal blades spreading to arcuate-spreading, needlelike, 0.8–2 cm × 0.4–0.8 mm, ± rigid, not fleshy, herbaceous, apex spinose, glabrous, not glaucous. Inflorescences: (1–)3–6-flowered, open cymes. Pedicels 6–25 mm, stipitate-glandular. Flowers: sepals 1–3-veined, lateral veins less developed, narrowly elliptic to ovate, 3.5–4 mm, 4.8–5.2 mm in fruit, margins usually broadly winged, scarious, apex broadly acute to obtuse (at least in fruit), glabrous or nearly so; petals yellowish white, spatulate, 5.8–10 mm, 1.3–1.5 times as long as sepals, apex rounded; nectaries as lateral and abaxial rounding of base of filaments opposite sepals, 0.2–0.3 mm. Capsules 7–10 mm, glabrous. Seeds brownish black, suborbicular with hilar notch, 2–2.4 mm, tuberculate; tubercles rounded, elongate.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>oak and yellow pine forests</habitat><elevation>1500–2800 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><discussion>Eremogone aberrans is known only from northern Arizona and resembles a robust form of the more northerly occurring E. aculeata. In Arizona it is often confused with E. fendleri, which has sepals more or less glandular-pubescent whereas E. aberrans has sepals glabrous or with a few glandular hairs at their bases.</discussion></treatment>
