  <discussion>Eriogonum lobbii is rather infrequent throughout its range. It is found in three widely scattered areas of concentration: the high mountains of northwestern California and southwestern Oregon; the southern portion of the North Coast Range of California; and the Sierra Nevada of eastern California and west-central Nevada. In the first two areas, the plants frequently are associated with serpentine soils; elsewhere the species is found almost exclusively on granitic soils and infrequently on volcanic ones. There are some morphologic differences between the Sierran plants and those of the coastal mountains, but no taxonomic separation is suggested. The species is a food plant for the intermediate dotted-blue butterfly (Euphilotes intermedia).</discussion>
