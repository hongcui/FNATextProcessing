  <description>Plants perennial shrubs or suffrutescent herbs; roots not known. Stems erect,
    prostrate, or climbing, ribbed. Leaves cauline, sessile or short-petiolate (petiole usually less
    than 1.5 cm); blade elliptic to oblanceolate or spatulate, base narrowed, margins entire, apex
    acute, acuminate, or obtuse, membranaceous. Inflorescences terminal or axillary spikelike
    racemes or panicles. Pedicels 2-bracteolate, short. Flowers sometimes heterostylous,
    short-pedicellate; bracts absent; calyx persistent, 5-ribbed, tubular, with stalked,
    capitate-glandular protuberances along ribs; lobes triangular, 1–2 mm; corolla salverform,
    evenly to somewhat unevenly 5-lobed, lobes spreading, obovate, round, or truncate, mucronate;
    stamens included or exserted, free from corolla; style 1 included or exserted; stigmas 5,
    linear. Fruits capsules, included, brownish, long-beaked; valves coherent at apex. x =

  <discussion>Several species of Plumbago are cultivated, including P. auriculata. The entire plant
    of that species, especially the root, contains plumbagin, a toxic naphthoquinone derivative (oil
    of plumbago), which may cause severe skin irritation or blistering in humans and may also be
    toxic to other animals (T. C. Fuller and E. McClintock 1986).</discussion>
  <discussion>The remarkable glands on the calyces of Plumbago are often called “glandular hairs,”
    but they are not true hairs, being much more massive and multicellular structures with enlarged,
    capitate apices.</discussion>
