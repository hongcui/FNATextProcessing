Inflorescences umbellate, 2–10 × 2–9 cm; branches umbellate, tomentose; bracts 2–4(–6), semileaflike, narrowly oblong to narrowly elliptic, 2–5 × 1–2 mm. Peduncles erect, slender, (1.5–)2–8.5(–9.5) cm, tomentose to glabrate. Involucres 1 per node, broadly campanulate, 2–3 × (2–)3–4(–5) mm, tomentose and densely glandular abaxially; teeth 5–7, erect, 1–1.2 mm. Flowers 4–6 mm; perianth white, densely villous and glandular abaxially; tepals connate proximal 1/4, monomorphic, obovate; stamens included to exserted, 2.5–6.5 mm; filaments sparsely pilose proximally.
