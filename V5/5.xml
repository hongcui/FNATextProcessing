Duke</variety_authority></TaxonIdentification><description>Plants annual, herbaceous, gla-brous or minutely puberulent, not glaucous. Stems ascending to erect, generally branching at base, 0.5–5 cm. Leaves opposite; stipules ± deciduous, simple, subulate, 0.5–1.2 mm; petiole absent or nearly so; blade orbiculate to spatulate (basal leaves) or oblong (cauline leaves), 0.3–1 cm × 0.2–3 mm, base attenuate, apex rounded to acute. Inflorescences terminal, congested to open, 3–25+-flowered cymes. Pedicels mostly shorter than subtending bracts at maturity. Flowers: sepals with 3 prominent, ± parallel, apically confluent veins, lanceolate, oblong, or ovate (herbaceous portion ± oblong), 1.8–2.3 mm, ± equal, apex blunt or rounded, hood at ± right angle to apex, formed in part by scarious margins, glabrous; petals 2-fid for ca. 1/2 their length, 1.5–2.8 mm, 3/4–1 times as long as sepals, lobes 1-veined, vein unbranched, linear, trunk absent, base gradually tapered, apex rounded. Seeds light reddish brown to tan, snail-shell- to teardrop-shaped, 0.5–0.6 mm; tubercles minute, rounded.</description><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><phenology>nov</phenology><habitat>rocky or gravelly slopes</habitat><habitat>disturbed areas in pine or aspen woodland</habitat><elevation>2200–3100 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Colo.</us_distribution><us_distribution>N.Mex.</us_distribution><global_distribution>Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution>Central America.</global_distribution><discussion>Drymaria depressa has been treated as a variety of D. effusa, from which it differs in a number of respects, as indicated in the key.</discussion></treatment>
