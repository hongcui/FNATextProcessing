  <discussion>Gypsophila elegans is frequently included in mixtures of “wildflower” seeds used for roadside planting and other revegetation projects. A specimen specifically from such a mixture was seen from Louisiana, but such mixtures are used widely elsewhere and are believed to account for the presence of this species in Colorado and in at least one Utah locality. A report of this species from Labrador appears to have been based on garden plants.</discussion>
  <discussion>If Gypsophila elegans is divided into two varieties, following Y. I. Barkoudah (1962), plants in the flora area are var. elegans. Cultivars are much used by florists and are frequently grown as garden ornamentals. These may have supernumerary petals, petals to 25 mm, and/or pink to maroon petals.</discussion>
