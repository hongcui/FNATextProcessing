Stems erect, rarely as-cending, several from base, branched in inflorescence, 5–15(–20) cm; shoots usually densely crowded, not elongated. Leaves: ocrea brownish or reddish brown, membranous; blade linear or spatulate-lanceolate, not hastate (without basal lobes), 1.5–5 × 0.1–0.3 cm, base narrowly cuneate (gradually narrowing into petiole), margins entire, flat or slightly convolute, apex obtuse or subacute. Inflorescences terminal, occupying more than distal 1/2 of stem, ± dense, usually interrupted at least near base, narrowly paniculate with branches directed upward. Pedicels 1–4 mm. Flowers (3–)4–7 in whorls; inner tepals distinctly enlarged, 1.6–2.3 × 1.8–2.5 mm (free wing 0.3–0.5 mm wide), base cuneate, apex obtuse or subacute. Achenes brown or reddish brown, 1–1.5 × 0.8–1.2 mm. 2n = 14.</description><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>sandy and gravelly soil</habitat><habitat>shores</habitat><habitat>limestone outcrops</habitat><elevation>0–300 m;</elevation><ca_distribution>Yukon</ca_distribution><us_distribution>Alaska</us_distribution><global_distribution>ne Asia (ne Russian Far East).</global_distribution><discussion>The name Rumex graminifolius was commonly misapplied to this species in both northwestern North America and northeastern Eurasia.</discussion></treatment>
