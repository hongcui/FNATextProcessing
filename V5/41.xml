Thieret</author><author>Richard K. Rabeler</author><description>Herbs, annual. Taproots slender. Stems prostrate to erect, branched, terete to finely ridged. Leaves opposite or in whorls of 4, not connate, petiolate; stipules 2 per node, silvery, lanceolate to triangular-ovate, margins entire or irregularly cut, apex acuminate to aristate; blade 1-veined, spatulate or oblanceolate to ovate or elliptic, not succulent, apex obtuse, sometimes mucronate. Inflorescences terminal or axillary, dense or lax cymes; bracts paired or absent. Pedicels erect. Flowers: perianth and androecium perigynous; hypanthium minute, cup-shaped, not abruptly expanded distally; sepals distinct, green, lanceolate to elliptic or ovate, often keeled, 1–2.5 mm, herbaceous, margins white, scarious, apex acute, ± hooded, ± awned; petals often fugacious, 5, white, blade apex emarginate; nectaries between filament bases; stamens 3–5; filaments shortly connate distally around ovary; style 1, obscurely 3-branched, filiform, 0.1–0.3 mm, glabrous proximally; stigmas 3, linear along adaxial surface of style branches, papillate (30×). Capsules ovoid to spherical, opening by 3 incurved or twisting valves; carpophore present. Seeds ca. 8–15, whitish, ovoid to lenticular or triangular, laterally compressed to angular, papillate or granular, marginal wing absent, appendage absent. x = [7], 8, 9.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species ca. 9 or 15 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>w North America</global_distribution><global_distribution>South America</global_distribution><global_distribution>Europe (including Mediterranean region)</global_distribution><global_distribution>Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution>Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution>Polycarpon tetraphyllum introduced widely</global_distribution><global_distribution>including e North America</global_distribution><global_distribution>Australia.</global_distribution><discussion>C.
