  <discussion>Eriogonum temblorense is rare but much more widely distributed than the closely related E. eastwoodianum. In early anthesis, it is difficult to differentiate between the two species, and plants gathered in May at Cottonwood Pass are particularly troublesome, as the first basal leaf blades are often suborbiculate. Those leaves quickly fall away, and the subsequent basal and cauline leaf blades are elliptic. As circumscribed here, E. temblorense is known from six sites in Monterey (Stone Canyon), San Luis Obispo (Cottonwood Pass and Polonio Pass areas), and Kern (Chico Martinez Canyon, Shale Hills, and hills west of McKittrick) counties.</discussion>
