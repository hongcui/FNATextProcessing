Given the extensive urbanization in southern California, California spineflower is now uncommon there. Along the coast, and especially in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, it can be weedy in deep, moving sands. Mucronea californica and M. perfoliata sometimes are found growing together without indication of intergradation.</discussion></treatment>
