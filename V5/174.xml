  <discussion>Until recently Cerastium fastigiatum was included in C. nutans but it is readily separable by its bushy, ascending habit, shorter pubescence, long, narrow leaves, and smaller capsule. It can be very similar to forms of C. brachypodum but differs from that species in its longer pedicels, narrowly acute leaves, glandular pubescence on the stems, and much more branched (fastigiate) habit. From C. nutans var. obtectum it differs in its very narrow sepals, narrowly lanceolate leaves, and smaller capsule.</discussion>
