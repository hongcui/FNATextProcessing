It is found along the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada in Mono County, California, mainly in the Bridgeport, Mono Lake, and Long Valley areas (south of Mammoth). It occurs also in Alkali Valley in Mineral County, Nevada, and to the south in Fish Lake Valley of Esmeralda County. The species recently has been seen as a roadside weed along U.S. Highway 395 near Big Pine in Inyo County, California. The plants typically are infrequent and only occasionally locally common. The species is considered “sensitive” in Nevada.</discussion></treatment>
