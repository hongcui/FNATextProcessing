Hernandez spineflower is restricted to five small populations of a few individuals each. Plants of this taxon were variously identified as C. palmeri, C. biloba, or C. obovata prior to 1989. C. B. Hardham (1989) believed that the variety may be a product of past hybridization, given the variation in chromosome number. She also found meiotic chromosomes of three size classes, numerous nucleoli, and atypical pollen grains.</discussion></treatment>
