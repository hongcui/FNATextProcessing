  <discussion>Varieties 2 (2 in the flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>Until recently Cerastium velutinum has been included in C. arvense as a variety or subspecies. However, morphological characters and chromosome number (diploid in the native forms of C. arvense, tetraploid in C. velutinum) distinguish the two taxa. They are not interfertile. Crosses between them can be produced with difficulty but they are completely sterile. None are known to occur naturally.</discussion>
  <discussion>An apparent hybrid between Cerastium velutinum and C. tometosum has been collected on the south shore of Lake Erie. It was completely sterile.</discussion>
