Historical records from the 1830s exist as specimens collected at Baltimore, Maryland, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the species has not been recollected in either place since. The Illinois population, first documented in 1993, is scattered over an acre of a mowed field in a city park.</discussion></treatment>
