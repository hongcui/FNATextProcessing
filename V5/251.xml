Stems ascending to erect, green, 4–15 cm, trailing stems to 30 cm, glabrous, internodes of flowering stems ca. as long as leaves. Leaves overlapping proximally, all evenly spaced, connate proxi-mally, with tight, scarious sheath 0.5–0.7 mm; blade arcuate, green, flat, 3-veined, needlelike to subulate, 3–6(–9) × 0.7–2 mm, ± rigid, margins scarious proximally, apex green, blunt to ± acute, dull, glabrous; axillary leaves present among vegetative leaves. Inflorescences 5–20-flowered, open cymes; bracts narrowly lanceolate, herbaceous, thinly scarious-margined. Pedicels 0.5–2.5 cm, sparsely stipitate-glandular. Flowers: hypanthium dish-shaped; sepals (1- or) 3-veined, narrowly lanceolate (herbaceous portion narrowly lanceolate), 5–6 mm, not enlarging in fruit, apex often purple, acute to acuminate, not hooded, sparsely stipitate-glandular; petals broadly linear to oblong-elliptic, 0.7–0.9 times as long as sepals, apex rounded, entire to slightly emarginate. Capsules ellipsoid, 4–4.8 mm, shorter than sepals. Seeds purplish brown, elliptic-oblong, ± compressed, 1.8–2.2 mm, tuberculate; tubercles low, rounded.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>jeffrey pine woodlands</habitat><habitat>serpentine soils</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>1200–1500 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><discussion>Minuartia decumbens, like M. rosei and M. stolonifera, is restricted to serpentine soils of northwestern California, specifically to Mule Ridge in Trinity County.
