Stems erect, scarcely branched, 20–100 cm, glabrous. Leaves: blade linear to narrowly oblanceolate, 3–16 cm × 3–12 mm, ± fleshy, base tapering into short petiole, apex acute, glabrous except for few cilia at base. Inflorescences cymose, terminal and axillary, elongate, 1–3-flowered, open, bracteate, bracteolate, pedunculate; peduncle slender, 2–10 cm; bracts and bracteoles much-reduced, linear-lanceolate, often ciliate. Pedicels slender, 2–10 cm. Flowers: calyx tubular, 17–22 × 4–5 mm in flower, broadening to 7 mm in fruit but contracted around carpophore, glabrous, lobes lanceolate, 3–4 mm, margins membranous and ciliate near broad, obtuse apex; corolla scarlet, 2–21/2 times longer than calyx, limb lanceolate, narrowed into claw, 4–5 mm wide, margins entire or shallowly dentate, appendages linear, 4–5 mm; stamens exserted; styles 3, exserted. Capsules clavate, equaling calyx, opening by 6 teeth; carpophore 3–4 mm. Seeds brown, broadly reniform, 2–2.3 mm, rugose. 2n = 48.</description><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><phenology>nov</phenology><habitat>sandy soil</habitat><habitat>open woodlands</habitat><habitat>river banks</habitat><elevation>10–200 m;</elevation><us_distribution>La.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Tex.</us_distribution><discussion>Silene subciliata, a very rare species, is closely related to S. laciniata and S. virginica but is readily distinguished by its subglabrous stems and leaves and by having unlobed petals.</discussion><discussion>Silene subciliata is in the Center for Plant Conservation’s National Collection of Endangered Plants.</discussion></treatment>
