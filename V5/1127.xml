Leaves: ocrea 6.5–12 mm, proximal part cylindric, pruinose, distal part hyaline, soon disintegrating into brown fibers or nearly completely deciduous; petiole 0–1 mm; blade green to bluish green, elliptic-lanceolate to linear, 10–35 × 1.5–15 mm, margins flat or narrowly revolute, apex acute; middle stem leaves slightly larger than adjacent branch leaves, distal leaves overtopping flowers. Inflorescences axillary, cymes uniformly distributed, 2–7-flowered. Pedicels exserted from ocreae, 2.5–5(–7) mm. Flowers semi-open; perianth 3.5–5.5 mm; tube 28–39% of perianth length; tepals slightly overlapping, green, margins white to pink, petaloid, not keeled, oblong to obovate, not cucullate; veins branched; stamens 8. Achenes exserted from perianth, pale brown to dark brown, ovate, 3-gonous, (3.5–)4.1–5.5(–6.5) mm, faces subequal, apex not beaked, edges straight, shiny, smooth or with fine tubercles especially toward apex; late-season achenes unknown.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Subspecies 3 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><introduced>introduced;</introduced><global_distribution>e North America</global_distribution><global_distribution>Europe.</global_distribution><discussion>The treatment by D.
