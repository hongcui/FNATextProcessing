Stems prostrate to ascending or erect, usually diffusely branched, sharply 4-angled, (5–)25–50 cm, glabrous to finely papillate, rarely pubescent. Leaves sessile; blade linear-lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate, rarely elliptic-lanceolate, 1–6 cm × 2–8 mm, base cuneate, margins eciliate or scabrid, sometimes ciliate towards base, apex acute. Inflorescences with flowers solitary, terminal and axillary, or terminal, often copious, very lax, leafy cymes; bracts foliaceous, lanceolate, reduced distally to ca. 2 mm, ± scarious. Pedicels erect or patent, usually reflexed at maturity, 10–40 mm, glabrous. Flowers 3–5 mm; sepals 5, 1–3-veined, lanceolate to ovate, 2–5 mm, margins scarious, apex acute, glabrous; petals 5, rarely absent, white or translucent, 1–3 mm, usually shorter than sepals; stamens 5; styles 3, erect to spreading, 0.9–2 mm. Capsules greenish brown or straw colored, ovoid, 3–7 mm, more than 1–1.5 times as long as broad, exceeding sepals, apex acute, opening by 3 valves; carpophore very short or absent. Seeds 10–20, brown, obovate, 0.7–0.9 mm on longest axis, smooth or slightly rugose. 2n = 52.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Subspecies 2 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>circumboreal.</global_distribution><discussion>Plants infected with an anther smut, Microbotyrum stellariae (Sowerby) G.
