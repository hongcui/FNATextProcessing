  <discussion>Variety elatum is found mainly along the eastern edge of the Cascade Ranges in Washington south into northern Oregon, and skips to the Siskiyou/Trinity mountains of southwestern Oregon and northwestern California. To the east in the desert ranges, it is found in south-central Oregon and northeastern California. The third major area of concentration is in the Sierra Nevada of California and east into some of the desert ranges in west-central Nevada. It is found as an isolated disjunct at Lloyd Meadows in Tulare County, and on the Kern Plateau in Kern County, California. An 1876 collection labeled as being from Auburn, Placer County, California (Ames s.n., WIS), is discounted, as that location is doubtful.</discussion>
