Elsewhere it is found in widely scattered disjunct populations on Bromley Ridge in the La Sal Mountains in northern San Juan County, and near the abandoned townsite of Rainbow in southeastern Uintah County. It is only marginally distinct from var. corymbosum. Some populations of E. lonchophyllum closely resemble var. revealianum, but that species always has glabrous inflorescences where such confusion might occur.</discussion></treatment>
