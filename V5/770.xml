Stems: caudex spreading; aerial flowering stems erect, slender, solid, not fistulose, arising at nodes of caudex branches and at distal nodes of short, non-flowering aerial branches, 0.8–2.5(–3) dm, essentially glabrous. Leaves basal, occasionally in rosettes; petiole 0.3–4 cm, hirtellous; blade broadly oblanceolate to elliptic or ovate, 0.5–2(–2.5) × 0.3–0.8(–1.2) cm, hirtellous to glabrescent, margins plane, entire. Inflorescences subcapitate, (1.5–)2–5 cm wide; branches subglabrous; bracts 5, semileaflike, 0.2–0.5 × 0.1–0.2 cm, absent immediately below involucre. Involucres 1 per node (often appearing clustered), narrowly turbinate, 5–6 × 2–3 mm, hirtellous; teeth 5–6, erect, 0.8–1 mm. Flowers 3–3.5(–4) mm, including 0.1–0.2 mm stipelike base; perianth bright yellow, sparsely white-pilose abaxially; tepals dimorphic, those of outer whorl spatulate, 2.5–3 mm wide, those of inner whorl oblanceolate, 1 mm wide; stamens exserted, 3–5 mm; filaments pilose proximally. Achenes light brown, 3–3.5 mm, glabrous except for pubescent beak.</description><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><habitat>serpentine slopes and outcrops</habitat><habitat>oak and conifer woodlands</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>(1100–)1300–1700(–2000) m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><discussion>Eriogonum hirtellum is known only from a few scattered locations in the Klamath Mountains of Siskiyou County and just over the boundary in Del Norte County.
