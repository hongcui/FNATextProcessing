Flowers: sepals 3–4 mm; petals ovate, 2/3–7/8 times as long as sepals in flower, apex obtuse; stamens usually 10. Capsule valves 3.5–6 mm.

It should be expected elsewhere in the flora area; the collections from Maryland and Massachusetts date from 2002 and 2000 respectively, with the Maryland population described as including “thousands of plants” (B.
