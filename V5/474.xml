Stems spreading or erect, without persistent leaf bases, up to 1/2 height of plant; caudex stems absent; aerial flowering stems erect or nearly so, slender, solid, not fistulose, 0.05–0.3 dm, thinly tomentose. Leaves cauline, fasciculate; petiole 0.05–0.1 cm, glabrous; blade linear-oblanceolate or linear-elliptic, 0.3–0.8(–1) × (0.05–)0.1–0.2 cm, densely white-tomentose abaxially, thinly floccose or glabrous and greenish adaxially, margins rolled. Inflorescences cymose, compact, 1–3 × 1–3 cm; branches dichotomous, thinly tomentose; bracts 3, scalelike, triangular, (0.5–)1–2 mm. Peduncles absent or erect, 0.1–0.8(–1) cm, thinly tomentose. Involucres 1 per node, campanulate, 3–4.5 × 2.5–3.5 mm wide, thinly tomentose to subglabrous; teeth 5, erect, 0.5–1.2 mm. Flowers 3.5–4.5(–5) mm; perianth white, glabrous; tepals connate proximal 1/3, dimorphic, those of outer whorl broadly cordate, 2–3 mm wide, apex rounded, those of inner whorl oblanceolate, 1–2 mm wide; stamens exserted, 3.5–4.5 mm; filaments pilose proximally. Achenes light brown, 4–4.5 mm, glabrous.</description><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><phenology>nov</phenology><habitat>clayey slopes and flat, creosote bush communities</habitat><elevation>1000–1200 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><discussion>Eriogonum terrenatum is confined to two geographically separate areas.
