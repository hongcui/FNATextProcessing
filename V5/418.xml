Stems numerous, decumbent to ascending, branched, tufted, leafy, slender, 5–30 cm. Leaves 2 per node, sessile or nearly so, blade reticulate-veined, lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate, thin, 0.8–2 cm × 3–8 mm, broadest proximally, base rounded, apex acute. Inflorescences cymose, open, compound, leafy, single flowers borne terminally and in axils of distal leaves; bracteoles, when present, 2. Pedicels straight, slender, 1/2–3 times longer than calyx. Flowers: calyx green, obscurely 10-veined, narrowly campanulate, in fruit 6–9 × 3–4 mm, herbaceous, pubescent, veins without conspicuous pale commissures; lobes triangular, 2–3 mm; corolla dark red, sometimes white, clawed, claw slightly longer than calyx, limb deeply 2-lobed, 2–3 mm, appendages 2, very small; stamens exserted; styles 3, exserted. Capsules ellipsoid, included in calyx, opening by 6 teeth; carpophore ca. 1.5 mm. Seeds brown, not winged, broadly reniform, flattened, ca. 0.8 mm, reticulate. 2n = 24.</description><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>crevices and ledges on granite and basalt cliffs</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>800–1800 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Wash.</us_distribution><discussion>Silene seelyi is confined to the Wenatchee Mountains.
