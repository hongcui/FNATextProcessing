Stems ascending to erect, sometimes scandent, glabrous or retrorsely hispid. Leaves: ocrea brownish, cylindric, 15–25(–50) mm, coriaceous proximally, chartaceous distally, base often inflated, margins oblique, eciliate, surface glabrous or pubescent; petiole 1–2.5 cm, winged at least distally; blade lanceolate to ovate or elliptic, 4–16 × 1.5–8 cm, base truncate to broadly cordate, margins glabrous or antrorsely scabrous with whitish hairs, apex acuminate, faces glabrous or hispid abaxially and adaxially, sometimes pubescent only along veins abaxially, not glandular-punctate but often minutely reddish-punctate abaxially. Inflorescences terminal or terminal and axillary, 3–6 × 3–6 mm; peduncle 10–30 mm, stipitate-glandular along entire length; ocreolae overlapping, margins eciliate. Pedicels mostly ascending, 2–3 mm. Flowers 1–3 per ocreate fascicle; perianth white to pink, campanulate, glabrous, accrescent; tepals 5, ovate, 3–4 mm, apex acute to obtuse; stamens 8, filaments distinct, free; anthers red or purple, elliptic; styles 3, connate proximally. Achenes included in fleshy, bluish black perianth, black, 3-gonous, 2.8–4 × 2–3 mm, dull, minutely punctuate.</description><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><habitat>disturbed places</habitat><elevation>0–100 m;</elevation><introduced>introduced;</introduced><us_distribution>Md.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Mass.</us_distribution><us_distribution>N.J.</us_distribution><global_distribution>Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution>introduced also in the Pacific Islands (Hawaii).</global_distribution><discussion>Varieties of Persicaria chinensis have been distinguished on the basis of stem pubescence, leaf shape, and leaf size.
