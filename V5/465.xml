It also occurs in San Juan County, but there it is restricted to portions of Canyonlands National Park, and is just inside the eastern edge of Sevier County. It is encountered also, albeit rarely, in Navajo County, Arizona. Variety leptocladon is worthy of cultivation, especially those expressions with densely white-tomentose inflorescence branches such as found in the Dolores Triangle area north of Ryan Creek in Grand County (e.g., Atwood &amp; Welsh 23213, BRY).</discussion></treatment>
