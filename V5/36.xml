    <description>Plants strongly perennial with branched, woody base, stout, 11–30 cm,
        stipitate-glandular in inflorescence or throughout. Taproots becoming stout, woody. Stems
        erect to ascending, often arcuately so, much-branched proximally; main stem 0.4–1.3 mm diam.
        proximally. Leaves: stipules ± conspicuous, dull white, broadly lance-acuminate, 3–8 mm,
        apex mucronate; blade filiform to linear, 1–4.2 cm, somewhat fleshy, apex apiculate or
        spine-tipped; axillary leaves 2–4 per cluster. Cymes simple to 3-compound. Pedicels
        spreading to reflexed in fruit. Flowers: sepals connate 0.5–0.7 mm proximally, lobes 1- or
        3-veined, lance-ovate to lanceolate, 2.5–4 mm, to 5 mm in fruit, margins 0.1–0.6 mm wide,
        apex acute to acuminate but often briefly rounded at tip; petals white, ± elliptic, 0.7–0.8
        times as long as sepal; stamens 7–10; styles 0.4–0.6 mm. Capsules greenish to tan, (4–)5–6.5
        mm, 1.1–1.3 times as long as sepals. Seeds reddish brown to dark brown, often with
        submarginal groove, broadly ovate, plump, 0.4–0.5 mm, smooth, often sculptured with
        parallel, wavy lines, papillae often present; wing often present, white, 0.1–0.2 mm wide,
        margins irregular.</description>
