Stems: caudex absent; aerial flowering stems erect, solid, not fistulose, 0.3–1 dm, glandular. Leaves basal; petiole 0.5–4 cm, glabrous or sparsely pilose; blade broadly elliptic to oval, 0.7–2.5 × 0.7–2.5 cm, pilose-hirsutulous, rarely slightly glandular and green on both surfaces, margins entire. Inflorescences cymose, open, spreading, 5–25 × 5–35 cm; branches not fistulose, glandular; bracts 3, scalelike, 1–2 × 0.5–1.5(–2) mm. Peduncles absent or ascending to erect, straight or curved, slender, 0.2–0.5 cm at proximal nodes, 0.01–0.1 cm distally, proximal 1/2 sparsely glandular. Involucres turbinate-campanulate, 1.3–2 × 1–2 mm, glabrous; teeth (4–)5, erect, 0.5–0.8 mm. Flowers 1–1.5(–2) mm; perianth yellow with reddish midribs to entirely reddish, densely pilose; tepals monomorphic, lanceolate; stamens exserted, 1–1.5 mm; filaments glabrous. Achenes dull brown, 3-gonous, 1.5–1.8 mm, glabrous.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><habitat>sandy to gravelly, often volcanic slopes</habitat><habitat>saltbush, greasewood, and sagebrush commun-ities</habitat><habitat>pinyon-juniper woodlands</habitat><elevation>(700–)1200–2100 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Nev.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Utah.</us_distribution><discussion>Eriogonum howellianum is encountered infrequently in widely scattered locations in southern Nevada (Clark, Lincoln, Nye, and White Pine counties) and west-central Utah (Juab, Millard, and Tooele counties). A disjunct population occurs on Pilot Peak in extreme eastern Elko County, Nevada. This species is rarely common. The name E. glandulosum was long misapplied to these plants.</discussion></treatment>
