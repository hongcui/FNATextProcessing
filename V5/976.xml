    <discussion>G. J. Goodman (1934) assigned Chorizanthe polygonoides to Acanthogonum, which
        previously included C. rigida and C. corrugata (see below). J. L. Reveal and C. B. Hardham
        (1989b) considered that taxon to represent a section within Chorizanthe, expanded it further
        to include both C. orcuttiana and C. watsonii, and divided it into five subsections. Section
        Acanthogonum differs from sect. Ptelosepala by having involucral tubes that are not both
        6-ribbed and 6-toothed at the same time.</discussion>
