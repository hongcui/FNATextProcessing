Stems: caudex absent; aerial flowering stems erect, stout, solid, not fistulose, arising directly from a taproot, (0.5–)1–2 dm, tomentose. Leaves basal, not in rosettes; petiole 4–10 cm, tomentose to floccose; blade lanceolate to elliptic, (2–)4–12(–15) × 1–3.5 cm, densely white-tomentose abaxially, floccose or glabrous and green adaxially, margins entire, plane. Inflorescences compound-umbellate, 5–15(–20) × 3–10(–12) cm; branches tomentose; bracts 3–6, leaflike at proximal node, 1–4 × 0.5–1.5(–1.8) cm, often scalelike distally. Involucres 1 per node, turbinate to campanulate, 3–5 × 2–4 mm, tomentose; teeth 5–7, erect or slightly spreading, 0.3–0.6 mm. Flowers (2.5–)3–7 mm, including 1–1.5(–2) mm stipelike base; perianth bright yellow, densely pubescent; tepals dimorphic, those of outer whorl lanceolate to elliptic, 2.5–5 × 1.5–2.5 mm, those of inner whorl elliptic to fan-shaped, 4–7 × 2–3.5 mm; stamens exserted, 3–5 mm; filaments pilose proximally. Achenes light brown to brown, 3.5–6 mm, glabrous except for sparsely pubescent beak. 2n = 40.</description><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><habitat>on clayey flats and mounds</habitat><habitat>mesquite communities</habitat><habitat>oak and juniper woodlands</habitat><elevation>400–1000 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Tex.</us_distribution><discussion>Eriogonum correllii is known from a few scattered locations in northern Texas (Armstrong, Briscoe, Floyd, Foard, Hardeman, Knox, and Oldham counties).
