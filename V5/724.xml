Stems: caudex spreading; aerial flowering stems erect, slender, solid, not fistulose, arising at nodes of caudex branches and at distal nodes of short, nonflowering aerial branches, 0.5–1.5(–1.8) dm, thinly floccose, with a whorl of 3 bracts ca. midlength, similar to leaf blades, 0.5–0.7 × 0.2–0.4 cm. Leaves in compact basal rosettes; petiole 0.2–0.6 cm, tomentose; blade oblong to elliptic, 0.5–1.5(–2) × 0.3–0.5(–0.8) cm, densely white-tomentose abaxially, thinly tomentose and greenish adaxially, margins entire, plane. Inflorescences capitate, 1–1.5 cm wide; branches thinly floccose; bracts 3, leaflike, narrowly lanceolate to narrowly elliptic, 0.5–0.7 × 0.2–0.5 cm. Involucres 1 per node, turbinate-campanulate to campanulate, 4–8 × 5–8 mm, tomentose; teeth 5–8, erect, 0.5–1.5 mm. Flowers 5–8 mm, including 1–1.5 mm stipelike base; perianth sulphur yellow, sparsely pubescent abaxially; tepals monomorphic, spatulate to oblong; stamens mostly included, 4–6 mm; filaments pilose proximally. Achenes light brown, 4–5 mm, glabrous except for sparsely pubescent beak.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>sandy to gravelly serpentine slopes and outcrops</habitat><habitat>manzanita communities</habitat><habitat>oak and montane conifer woodlands</habitat><elevation>1100–1600 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><discussion>Eriogonum libertini is encountered infrequently in the Dubakella and Tedoc mountains area of Tehama and Trinity counties in northwestern California.
