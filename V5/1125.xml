  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><common_name>Marin knotweed</common_name><description>Plants often reddish tinged, heterophyllous, subsucculent. Stems prostrate to ascending, branching from base, not wiry, 15–40 cm. Leaves: ocrea 4–6 mm, proximal part funnelform, distal part silvery hyaline, soon disintegrating, leaving almost no fibrous remains; petiole 2–5 mm; blade often reddish tinged, elliptic to obovate or oblanceolate; 20–35 × 9–16 mm, margins flat, apex rounded; stem leaves (1.3–)2–2.6(–3.5) times as long as branch leaves; distal leaves overtopping flowers in distal part of inflorescence. Inflorescences axillary; cymes in most leaf axils, 1–4-flowered. Pedicels mostly exserted from ocreae, 2–4 mm. Flowers semi-open; perianth 3–3.5(–4) mm; tube 18–25% of perianth length; tepals overlapping, green, margins white or pink, petaloid, not keeled, broadly rounded, cucullate; midveins unbranched; stamens 8. Achenes exserted from perianth, brown, ovate, 3-gonous, 2.8–3.4(–4) mm, faces subequal or evidently unequal, apex not beaked, edges straight, shiny, minutely roughened; late-season achenes uncommon, 4.5–5 mm. 2n = 60.</description><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><habitat>coastal salt and brackish marshes</habitat><habitat>swamps</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>0–10 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><discussion>The origin and taxonomic affinities of Polygonum marinense are uncertain. T. R. Mertens and P. H. Raven (1965) suggested a relationship with P. oxyspermum C. A. Meyer &amp; Bunge or the Mediterranean P. robertii Loiseleur-Deslongchamps. Polygonum marinense may be confused with P. ramosissimum. It can be distinguished by its subsucculent texture, funnelform ocreae, leaves rounded at the apices, and semi-open flowers. Marin knotweed is known from fewer than 15 locations in Marin, Napa, Solano, and Sonoma counties; it is threatened by coastal development.</discussion></treatment>
