The first site consists of some 14 subpopulations in a sparsely vegetated, undisturbed area. The second site, found in 2000, has a single population. The species otherwise was last collected in Los Angeles County in 1929. A single collection (Geis 541, DS) was supposedly gathered near Santa Ana, Orange County, in 1902. San Fernando spineflower has been proposed for federal listing as an endangered species.</discussion></treatment>
