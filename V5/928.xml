  <discussion>Hollisteria is the only member of subtribe Hollisteriineae H. Gross. This view differs from that presented by J. L. Reveal and C. B. Hardham (1989), who included Chorizanthe and its relatives also in Hollisteriineae. In an unpublished thesis, Adrienne Russell (pers. comm.) has suggested that Hollisteria is more closely related to Eriogonum than to Chorizanthe. Reveal and Hardham noted that the transfer of Hollisteria from a place near Eriogonum to a position with Chorizanthe was done with “some trepidation.” There is no obvious place within Eriogonum subg. Ganysma to suggest as a point of origin for Hollisteria. Then, too, there is no place within Chorizanthe that one can comfortably suggest as such a point. By referring Hollisteria to its own subtribe, one acknowledges a relationship to Eriogonum, and recognizes that the single flower and base chromosome number of x = 21 are conditions unknown in the whole of Eriogonineae, although both features are common in Chorizanthineae.</discussion>
