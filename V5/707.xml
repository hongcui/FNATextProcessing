  <discussion>Variety juniporinum is widespread and infrequent in widely scattered and disjunct populations in isolated desert mountain ranges from southern Utah (Navajo Mountains, San Juan County and Beaverdam Mountains, Washington County) and north-central Arizona (Kaibab Plateau, Coconino County) westward across southern Nevada (Spring Range of Clark County, Mt. Irish and Mormon Range in Lincoln County, and Schell Creek and Snake ranges in White Pine County) to California (southeastern Inyo and northeastern San Bernardino counties, mainly Clark Mountain, Kingston, New York, and Providence ranges, and in the Mid Hills). A collection supposedly from the San Bernardino Mountains of California (Meebold 20381, M) surely is mislabeled.</discussion>
  <discussion>Variety juniporinum is most closely related to var. subaridum, but immature plants (or specimens without habit information) may be confused with var. versicolor. These plants most frequently are seen in San Bernardino County, California, and in White Pine County, Nevada. They would make an attractive addition to the garden.</discussion>
