Inflorescences axillary and terminal, spikelike; cymes aggregated at tips of stems and branches, 1–3-flowered. Pedicels enclosed in ocreae, 1.5–2 mm. Flowers closed or semi-open; perianth 2.2–3 mm; tube 15–30% of perianth length; tepals overlapping, green with white to pink margins, petaloid, not keeled, oblong, cucullate; veins branched; stamens 8. Achenes slightly exserted from perianth, light brown to dark brown, ovate, 3-gonous, 2–2.3(–2.8) mm, faces subequal, concave, apex not beaked, edges concave, dull, striate-tubercled; late-season achenes uncommon, 2.5–4 mm.</description><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><habitat>waste places</habitat><elevation>0–800 m;</elevation><introduced>introduced;</introduced><us_distribution>Ala.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Ill.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Wash.</us_distribution><global_distribution>Eurasia</global_distribution><global_distribution>n Africa.</global_distribution><discussion>The name Polygonum patulum has been misapplied to a distinctive form of P. ramosissimum in saline marshes in California (M.
