Taproots moderately stout, woody. Stems ascending to erect, green, 5–20 cm, glabrous except in inflorescence, glaucous, inter-nodes of stems 0.5–4 times as long as leaves (proximal leaves longer than internodes); rhizomes and trailing stems 5–20 cm. Leaves loosely overlapping proximally, ± evenly spaced, connate proximally, with tight, scarious sheath 0.2–0.6 mm; blade straight or outwardly curved, green, shallowly concave (dorsiventrally flattened, curved into trough), 1-veined abaxially, needlelike, 4–15 × 0.5–1.2 mm, ± flexuous, margins not thickened, scarious in proximal 1/5, smooth, apex green to purple, acute to obtuse, sometimes apiculate, navicular, dull, glabrous, glaucous; axillary leaves well developed among proximal cauline leaves. Inflorescences 12–25-flowered, open cymes; bracts subulate, herbaceous, margins scarious proximally. Pedicels 0.4–3 cm, often stipitate-glandular. Flowers: hypanthium disc-shaped; sepals obscurely 1-veined, narrowly ovate to lanceolate (herbaceous portion narrowly ovate to lanceolate), 2.5–4 mm, not enlarging in fruit, apex green to purple, acute to acuminate, not hooded, glabrous or very sparsely stipitate-glandular; petals oblanceolate to narrowly oblong-elliptic, 1.4–2.2 times as long as sepals, apex rounded, entire. Capsules sessile, ovoid, 3.5–4.3 mm, longer than sepals. Seeds reddish brown to brown, oblong-elliptic, compressed, 2.3–2.8 mm, tuberculate; tubercles low, rounded.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>open, serpentine slopes with scattered oak and jeffrey pine</habitat><elevation>700–1400 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><discussion>Minuartia rosei, like M. decumbens and M. stolonifera, is restricted to serpentine soils of northwestern California.
