It is worthy of the serious horticultural efforts now being made to develop cultivars for the arid garden, with selection development emphasizing large, round, fully flowering shrubs capable of surviving a wide range of temperatures. A mature plant in full flower is a remarkable sight. The hemispheric shrubs wholly and densely blanketed by bright white flowers and set against the deep red sands and sandy-clay hills in Monument Valley are seen in numerous photographs and several John Ford movies. An expression from Gypsum Valley, San Miguel County, Colorado, may well reprecent an undescribed variety allied to var. orbiculatum.</discussion></treatment>
