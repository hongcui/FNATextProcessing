Stems erect, branched above middle, 50–100(–130) cm. Leaves: ocrea mostly deciduous or rarely partially persistent at maturity; blade ovate-triangular, broadly ovate, or ovate-elliptic, 20–30 × 15–25 cm, base deeply and broadly cordate, margins entire to obscurely repand, usually slightly crisped or undulate, apex obtuse to subacute. Inflorescences terminal, occupying distal 1/2 of stem (branches often slightly arcuate at base), rather dense, widely paniculate. Pedicels articulated in proximal 1/3, filiform, 4–10 mm, articulation distinctly swollen. Flowers 15–30 in whorls; inner tepals orbiculate-reniform or broadly scutate, 6–9 × 6–11 mm, as long as wide or nearly so, base cordate to subcordate, margins entire or subentire, occasionally irregularly erose near base, apex abruptly acute to acute; tubercles usually 1, small, 1–2 mm, normally less than 2 times as wide as inner tepals, rarely absent or indistinct. Achenes reddish brown, 3–3.5 × 1.7–2.5 mm. 2n =40.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>roadsides</habitat><habitat>waste places</habitat><habitat>meadows</habitat><habitat>river valleys</habitat><elevation>300–700 m;</elevation><introduced>introduced;</introduced><ca_distribution>Alta.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution>Man.</ca_distribution><us_distribution>N.Dak.</us_distribution><global_distribution>e</global_distribution><global_distribution>ec Europe</global_distribution><global_distribution>w Asia (the Caucasus)</global_distribution><global_distribution>w Asia (Siberia)</global_distribution><global_distribution>introduced elsewhere.</global_distribution><discussion>Rumex confertus was placed in subsect.
