Overlying a portion of the range of var. umbellatum is the glabrous-leaved var. aureum, but the latter occurs over a greater area and mainly much farther to the west. Still, clear distinction between the two is not always possible. Variety umbellatum is found in cultivation, especially in European gardens.</discussion></treatment>
