In Arizona, it is known only from scattered locations in northern Mohave (west of Mt. Trumbull) and northwestern Coconino (Fredonia area) counties. In Nevada, it is known from White Valley (Nye County) and Spring Valley from Majors Place (White Pine County) to Pony Springs (Lincoln County). It is found also in the Buckskin Mountains of Kane County, Utah, and Coconino County, Arizona.</discussion></treatment>
