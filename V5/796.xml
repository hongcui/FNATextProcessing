  <discussion>Eriogonum apiculatum is restricted to the San Jacinto, Santa Rosa, Palomar, and Cuyamaca mountains of Riverside and San Diego counties. Two collections are discounted as to location: Hall 1025 (MIN), purportedly from the San Bernardino Mountains, certainly was labeled erroneously by the Parish brothers, who redistributed the sheet; and Jaeger s.n. (19 May 1940, DS, IDS, UTC, WTU) from “Falcon Flat” in the Little San Bernardino Mountains appears to be another of the small but significant list of Jaeger specimens with highly dubious label data. No such place is known in Joshua Tree National Park. The phase of the species named var. subvirgatum, with nearly sessile involucres, occurs intermixed with the typical expression.</discussion>
  <discussion>A yellow-flowered population was found at the eastern end of the San Bernardino Mountains, San Bernardino County. Recent attempts to relocate those plants have been unsuccessful, and they remain undescribed.</discussion>
