Stems erect to ascending, (3–)5–20(–25) cm, entirely glabrous or glabrous proximally, stipitate-glandular distally. Leaves: basal leaves abundant, persistent; cauline leaves in 1–3 pairs, abruptly reduced distal to lowest pair; basal blades erect, straight or often curved in one direction, filiform, (2–)4–8 cm × 0.5–1 mm, flexuous, herbaceous, apex acute or acuminate to weakly spinose, glabrous, sometimes stipitate-glandular, often glaucous. Inflorescences 1–12(–18)-flowered, open or rarely subcongested cymes. Pedicels (2–)5–20 mm, glabrous or stipitate-glandular. Flowers: sepals often purplish, 1–3-veined, ovate to ovate-lanceolate, 3–4.7 mm, to 5 mm in fruit, margins broad, apex broadly rounded to barely acute, glabrous or stipitate-glandular; petals white, spatulate, 6–10 mm, 1.5–2.5 times as long as sepals, apex broadly rounded; nectaries as depressed transverse cup at base of filaments opposite sepals, 0.3–0.7 × 0.1–0.3 mm. Capsules 5–8 mm, valves at least sparsely stipitate-glandular or glabrous. Seeds brown to black, ellipsoid to ovoid with hilar notch, (1.2–)1.5–2(–2.5) mm, tuberculate; tubercles rounded, elongate.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Varieties 2 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>North America</global_distribution><global_distribution>Asia (Siberia).</global_distribution><discussion>B. Maguire (1947, 1951) and subsequent workers separated these varieties of Eremogone capillaris by sepal length: (3–)3.5–4.5(–4.8) mm in var. americana and (3.6–)5–6(–6.6) mm in var. capillaris. Material available to us did not exhibit that distinction.</discussion><key><key_statement>
