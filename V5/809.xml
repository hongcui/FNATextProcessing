It is restricted to the southwestern edge of the pluvial Lahontan Lake basin of northwestern Nevada. It is found mainly in the Silver Springs and Wadsworth areas of Washoe, Churchill, and Storey counties, with outlying populations at the southern end of the Sahwave Mountains (Pershing County) and in Wilson Canyon (Lyon County). It is on the Nevada “watch list” of narrowly distributed endemic species.</discussion></treatment>
