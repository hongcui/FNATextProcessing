Stems prostrate, often zigzagged, branched mostly from base, wiry, 2–20(–40) cm. Leaves often opposite at proximal nodes; ocrea 2–3(–4) mm, proximal part funnelform, distal part soon lacerate, nearly completely deciduous; petiole 1–3.4 mm; blade usually reddish or purple tinged, obovate to oblanceolate, 3–12(–25) × (1.5–)2.5–4.5(–8) mm, margins flat, apex rounded to obtuse; stem leaves 1–1.5(–2) times as long as adjacent branch leaves, distal leaves overtopping flowers. Inflorescences axillary; cymes ± uniformly distributed, 2–6-flowered. Pedicels enclosed in ocreae, 0.5–1.5 mm. Flowers closed or semi-open; perianth 1.5–2.3(–3) mm; tube 28–49% of perianth length; tepals partially overlapping, green, margins pink, rarely white, petaloid, not keeled, oblong, ± outcurved, usually not cucullate; midveins unbranched or branched; stamens 5. Achenes exserted from perianth, dark brown to purple, ovate-lanceolate, 2–3-gonous, 1.4–1.6(–2.2) mm, faces unequal, apex not beaked or obscurely beaked, edges straight or concave, shiny or dull, smooth to roughened; late-season achenes common, 2–3.5 mm.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>gravel bars</habitat><habitat>waste places</habitat><elevation>20–700 m;</elevation><ca_distribution>N.W.T.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution>Nunavut</ca_distribution><ca_distribution>Yukon</ca_distribution><us_distribution>Alaska.</us_distribution><discussion>Polygonum humifusum often has opposite proximal leaves. In North America, the closest relative of subsp. caurianum is P. fowleri, rare individuals of which produce opposite leaves.</discussion><discussion>Three specimens of the Asian subsp. humifusum were collected near Nanaimo, Vancouver Island, by J. Macoun in 1883 and 1887 (J. F. Brenckle 1941); the subspecies has not been recollected there. It has stems and leaves that are green, and achenes 2.1–2.7 mm, ± beaked, and exserted 0.9–1.3 mm from the perianth at maturity.</discussion></treatment>
