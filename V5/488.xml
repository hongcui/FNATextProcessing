Stems spreading, without persistent leaf bases, up to 1/4 height of plant; caudex stems absent; aerial flowering stems erect or nearly so, somewhat stout, solid, not fistulose, 1–2(–2.5) dm, floccose. Leaves cauline on proximal 1–7(–9) cm of stem, 1 per node; petiole 1.5–4(–5) cm, tomentose; blade cordate, (1.5–)2–3.5 × 1–2(–2.5) cm, densely white-tomentose abaxially, floccose and greenish or brownish white adaxially, margins plane or crenulate. Inflorescences cymose, usually open, 3–15 × 5–20 cm; branches dichotomous, tomentose to floccose; bracts 3, scalelike, triangular, 1–4 mm. Peduncles absent. Involucres 1 per node, turbinate, 1.5–2(–2.5) × 1–1.5(–1.8) mm; teeth 5–6, erect, 0.3–0.5 mm. Flowers 2–3 mm; perianth brownish white, glabrous; tepals connate proximal 1/4, dimorphic, those of outer whorl obovate, 1.8–2 mm wide, those of inner whorl lanceolate to narrowly elliptic, 1–1.2 mm wide; stamens slightly exserted, 2.5–4 mm; filaments glabrous or sparsely pilose proximally. Achenes brown, 2–2.5 mm, glabrous.</description><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><phenology>nov</phenology><habitat>rocky limestone, sandstone or pumice washes</habitat><habitat>flats</habitat><habitat>and outcrops</habitat><habitat>saltbush, blackbrush, and sagebrush communities</habitat><habitat>pinyon-juniper woodlands</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>1200–2100 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><discussion>Eriogonum jonesii is found primarily in Coconino County, with scattered populations just entering Mohave and Navajo counties. Jones’s wild buckwheat would make an interesting addition to the garden. Although the plants are sometimes “leggy,” the white to brownish tomentum is attractive, as are the brownish-white flowers.</discussion></treatment>
