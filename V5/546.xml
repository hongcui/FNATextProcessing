  <discussion>Eriogonum argophyllum is known only from the Sulphur Hot Springs area in Ruby Valley, Elko County, where plants grow along runoff channels associated with the hot springs. In 2003 the species was removed as a candidate for federal protection on the basis of “additional pop[ulation]s, individuals, habitat,” although it is still known only from the type location, where protection is provided by an interested private landowner. The species is considered to be “critically endangered” by the state of Nevada, and is in the Center for Plant Conservation’s National Collection of Endangered Plants.</discussion>
