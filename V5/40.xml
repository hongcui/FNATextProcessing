Leaves dimorphic; basal (sometimes absent in older specimens) with petiole 2.5–4 mm, blade oblong-ovate to suborbiculate, 8–12 mm, margins flat, glabrous; cauline subtending fascicles of usually smaller leaves, blade linear, 1–2.5 cm, margins revolute, glabrous or ciliate. Cymes dense. Pedicels 0.8–3 mm. Flowers: sepals 2.2–3.1 mm; petals marcescent, elliptic to ovate, 0.7–1 mm; stigmas nearly sessile. Capsules 1.5 mm.

Lakela (1962, 1963). Although she eventually described her plants as a new species, subsequent authors have concluded that the features supposedly distinguishing it lie within the range of P. corymbosa, a widely distributed paleotropical taxon. It is now known from five counties in central Florida.</discussion><discussion>Polycarpaea corymbosa is morphologically diverse, especially in Africa. While at least five varieties have been described (four since 1975) for distinctive populations in Asia and South America, a thorough study across the range of the species is yet to be undertaken.</discussion><discussion>K. R. Beena et al. (2000) demonstrated the presence of endophytic fungi in Polycarpaea corymbosa.</discussion></treatment>
