    <description>Plants spreading to erect. Leaf blades oblanceolate to narrowly elliptic or
        spatulate. Stems disarticulating at each node. Inflorescences: bracts awned; involucres
        cylindric, slightly ventricose basally, 3-angled, 6-ribbed, 6-toothed, without membranous or
        scarious margins; awns equal. Flowers 1; perianth greenish white to white or pale yellowish
        white, glabrous; stamens 3, adnate at top of perianth tube. Achenes dark brown,
        lenticular.</description>

    <discussion>Chorizanthe brevicornu of western North America, and its counterpart in western
        South America, C. commissuralis J. RÃ©my, are the most widely distributed members of the
        genus on their respective continents. The flowering stems and branches easily break apart,
        often with involucres still firmly attached. Even in this disarticulated condition, young
        achenes will continue to live and mature. No doubt this is a significant factor in their
        successful distribution.</discussion>
