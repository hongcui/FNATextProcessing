    <description>Plants annual. Taproots filiform. Stems erect to ascending, green, 5–20 cm,
        stipitate-glandular, often densely so, internodes of all stems 1–3 times as long as leaves.
        Leaves overlapping proximally, perfoliate proximally, with ± loose, scarious to herbaceous
        sheath 0.5–1 mm; blade green, flat, 1-veined, oblanceolate to cuneate (proximal) to
        oblong-lanceolate to ovate (remaining cauline), 5–30(–35) × 2–4 mm, flexuous, margins not
        thickened, ± scarious, smooth, apex green to purple, obtuse to abruptly pointed, dull,
        glabrous; axillary leaves absent. Inflorescences 7–12-flowered, open cymes, or rarely
        solitary, terminal; bracts ± lanceolate, herbaceous, sometimes scarious-margined proximally.
        Pedicels reflexed in fruit, 0.5–2.5 cm, stipitate-glandular. Flowers: hypanthium
        disc-shaped; sepals obscurely veined, ovate to broadly elliptic (herbaceous portion ovate to
        broadly elliptic), 3–6 mm, to 7 mm in fruit, apex green or purple, acute to acuminate, not
        hooded, stipitate-glandular; petals obovate to oblanceolate, 2–2.5 times as long as sepals,
        apex rounded, broadly notched. Capsules sessile, broadly ellipsoid, 6–7.5 mm, equaling or
        longer than sepals. Seeds dark brown to blackish, orbiculate with radicle prolonged into
        beak, only slightly compressed, 0.7–0.8 mm, echinate with rounded tubercles.</description>

    <discussion>Minuartia drummondii is easily recognized by the proportionally large corollas
        (petals to three times as long as sepals) and pedicels reflexing in fruit.</discussion>
