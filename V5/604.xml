It approaches in habit the stoutly branched phase of var. argense known as var. subracemosum, but it lacks the papillate-scabrous condition. It also resembles var. sulcatum, but has only faintly grooved, rather than distinctly furrowed or deeply angled, inflorescence branches. It differs also in having the more open inflorescences of var. humilius. Both var. subspinosum and the subracemosum phase of var. argense have short, spinose lateral branches.</discussion></treatment>
