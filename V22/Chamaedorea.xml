Stems clustered [solitary], erect [creeping, lianoid], slender, unarmed. Leaves: sheaths tubular, unarmed, forming crownshaft; blade pinnate [undivided], with leaf segments regularly spaced along unarmed rachis, in 1 plane [many planes]; plication reduplicate; segments linear-lanceolate, apical pair of segments sometimes wider than others. Inflorescences axillary below crown of leaves, ascending, with 1 order of branching [spicate or 2 orders]; prophyll small; peduncular bracts 5--6, tubular, papery; rachillae green at anthesis, turning orange in fruit. Flowers unisexual, sessile, staminate and pistillate flowers on different plants. Staminate flowers borne singly, partially sunken into fleshy rachillae; sepals 3, briefly connate at base [distinct]; petals 3, ovate, basally briefly connate [connate by tips]; stamens 6, distinct; anthers dorsifixed; pistillode minute. Pistillate flowers borne singly, slightly sunken into fleshy rachillae; sepals 3, free; petals 3, free, ovate; staminodes 6, minute; pistil 1, 3-loculate; ovules 1 per locule; style indistinct; stigmas minute. Fruits drupes, globose; stigmatic scar basal, exocarp black, smooth; mesocarp thin; endocarp bony. Seeds globose; endosperm homogeneous; embryo subapical; eophyll 2-cleft [pinnate], segments linear. nx = 13.</description><discussion>Chamaedorea species are understory palms in Mexico, Central America, and northern South America.
