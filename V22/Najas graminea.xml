Leaves spreading to ascending with age, 0.8--2 cm, lax in age; sheath 1--1.5 mm wide, apex deeply auriculate; blade 0.5--1 mm wide, margins minutely serrulate, teeth 40 per side, apex acute with 2--3 teeth, teeth unicellular; midvein without prickles abaxially. Flowers 1--2 per axil, staminate and pistillate on same plants. Staminate flowers in distal axils, 2--3 mm; involucre beaks 4-lobed, 1--1.5 mm; anther 4-loculed, 1.5 mm. Pistillate flowers distal to proximal, to 3.5 mm; styles to 1 mm; stigmas 2-lobed. Seeds not recurved, greenish brown, fusiform, 1.7--2.5 &amp;#180; 0.4--6 mm, apex with style situated at center; testa dull, 3 cell layers thick, pitted; aeroleareoles regularly arranged in 35 longitudinal rows, not ladderlike, 4-angled, as long aser than broad, end walls slightly raised. 2n = 24, 36, 48 (Asia).</description><discussion>Because of the deeply auriculate sheaths, Najas graminea is one of the easiest of the North American and Central American Najas to recognize.
