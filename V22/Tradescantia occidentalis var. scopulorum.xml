Leaves: blade 5--45 &amp;#180; 0.4--0.9 cm. Flowers: pedicels 1--2 cm, glabrous; sepals 5--8 mm, glabrous; petals bright blue, 0.7--1 cm.</description><discussion>The two varieties intergrade; the only absolute difference between them is sepal pubescence. Tradescantia occidentalis var. scopulorum evidently was defined more broadly by W. C. Martin and C. R. Hutchins (1980), so the distribution I have shown for New Mexico could be too wide. A broader circumscription of this variety has also been used by others (C. Sinclair 1967; M. Bolick 1986), but I have not accepted these records.</discussion><discussion>Most specimens of Tradescantia occidentalis from Arkansas and Louisiana have an apical tuft of eglandular hairs on the sepals, a character acquired through introgression with T. ohiensis (E. Anderson and R. E. Woodson Jr. 1935).</discussion><discussion>Tradescantia occidentalis var. melanthera has been described for plants from Arkansas, Louisiana, eastern Texas and eastern Oklahoma that have dark anther connectives (D. T. MacRoberts 1977). I have not been able to recognize this character in dried specimens with any consistency.</discussion><phenology>Flowering spring--summer, fall (Apr--Aug, Oct)</phenology><habitat> Moist canyons and stream banks</habitat><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.Mex.</us_distribution></treatment>
