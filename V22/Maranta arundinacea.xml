In the early 1800s, it was commercially cultivated in Georgia and South Carolina (W. J. Titford 1812). This species is often referred to as St. Vincent arrowroot, after St. Vincent Island, West Indies, which is the major site of commercial production of the starch. The name arrowroot derives from its medicinal use as a poultice to remove arrow poison from wounds. The starch has also been used internally against ingested poison (R. Bentley and H. Trimen [1875--]1880, vol. 4, p. 265). Because the starch is so readily digested, it has been fed to infants, invalids, and those allergic to wheat. The cultivar 'Variegata,' with white and green variegated leaves, is often grown as an ornamental.</discussion><phenology>Flowering summer--winter</phenology><habitat> Hammocks and moist soil</habitat><elevation>0--10 m</elevation><introduced>introduced</introduced><us_distribution>Fla.</us_distribution><global_distribution>native</global_distribution><global_distribution> s Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution> n South America (w Ecuador).</global_distribution></treatment>
