  <discussion>Tradescantia pedicellata is a most unsatisfactory species. The species may have arisen as a hybrid between Tradescantia humilis and T. occidentalis and been recognized as a species because of its constant morphology and high pollen fertility (R. P. Celarier 1956). C. Sinclair (1967) concluded, however, that there was no evidence for the species' existence, and I have found it very difficult to recognize specimens that agree with the original description (no type has been located).</discussion>
  <discussion>Tradescantia diffusa Bush, a name overlooked by E. Anderson and R. E. Woodson Jr. (1935), has been considered the correct name for this plant (D. T. MacRoberts 1978). After examining the type of T. diffusa, I concluded that it was conspecific with the type of T. humilis.</discussion>
