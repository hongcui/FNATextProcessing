Leaves limp, unkeeled, flat, mostly 0.6--1 m &amp;#61620; 4--10 mm. Inflorescences: rachis 0--2-branched, distal part erect at water surface; bracts ascending, not inflated at base; pistillate heads 0--2 on main rachis, 1--2 on secondary rachises, axillary or supra-axillary, often some contiguous or nearly so, especially in fruit, sessile, 1.5--2.3 cm diam. in fruit; staminate heads 3--6 on main rachis, 1--4 on secondary rachises, contiguous or not, but not contiguous with distalmost pistillate head. Flowers: tepals often with prominent apical dark spot, apically erose to fimbriate; stigmas 1, linear-lanceolate. Fruits eventually dark reddish brown, dull, stipitate, elliptic to obovoid or fusiform, body not faceted, sometimes constricted near equator, 2--5 &amp;#61620; 1.5--2 mm, tapering to beak; beak curved, 2--3.5 mm; tepals borne at middle of fruit stipe, basally adnate to stipe, reaching about nearly to equator. Seeds 1.</description><discussion>The tepals are usually adnate to the fruit stipe for about half their length, but in our other species they are free from it.</discussion><discussion>Sparganium fluctuans is not known to hybridize. When vegetative, it is sometimes confused with S. angustifolium, but the floating leaves of that species are usually less than 5 mm wide and plano-convex. Sparganium fluctuans is more robust than the grasslike S. natans, with which it sometimes grows.</discussion><phenology>Flowering summer (Jul--Aug)</phenology><habitat> Quiet, cold, acidic -to -neutral oligotrophic waters to 2 m deep but usually less, abundant in some areas but not in others, sometimes covering the water with its strap-shaped leaves</habitat><elevation>0--600 m</elevation><ca_distribution>Alta</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Man.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> N.B.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Nfld. and Labr.
