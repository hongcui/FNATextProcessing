It is very popular in water gardening because it blooms during the cooler periods of the year. The plant does not do well in the heat of the summer. It flowers early in the growing season, goes dormant during the summer, and flowers again late in the season. Where the weather is mild, it will flower all winter. Presently, it is known in North America only from central-coastal and southern California.</discussion><phenology>Flowering late winter--spring (Mar--Apr), fall (Oct--Nov)</phenology><habitat> Quiet ponds</habitat><elevation>0--550 m</elevation><introduced>introduced</introduced><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><global_distribution>South America</global_distribution><global_distribution>Europe</global_distribution><global_distribution>Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution>Australia.</global_distribution></treatment>
