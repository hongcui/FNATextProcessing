Although not native, the coconut persists long after cultivation and is essentially naturalized in coastal southern Florida.

Presently, most cultivated individuals are resistant cultivars.</discussion><phenology>Flowering throughout the year</phenology><habitat> Coastal dune vegetation in sandy soils</habitat><elevation>ca. 0--10 m</elevation><introduced>introduced</introduced><us_distribution>Fla.</us_distribution><global_distribution>pantropical. native</global_distribution><global_distribution> Pacific Islands (Melanesia).</global_distribution></treatment>
