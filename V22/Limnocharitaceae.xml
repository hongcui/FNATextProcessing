Muenscher 1944). The genus was not included for Louisiana by J. W. Thieret (1972); it was included by R. K. Godfrey and J. W. Wooten (1979) on the basis of Muenscherâ€™s report although the authors stated that they had seen no specimens from the United States. Also, the genus is not mapped in the "Florida Atlas" (available on the Internet). Richard Wunderlin, primary compiler of the "Atlas"," has indicated that no specimens have been examined (pers. comm.).</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Genera 3, species 8 (1 genus, 1 species in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><introduced> introduced</introduced><global_distribution> tropical and subtropical regions</global_distribution><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution> Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution> Australia.</global_distribution><author>Robert R.
