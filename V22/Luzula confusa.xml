Culms cespitose, stiffly erect, 3--28 cm. Leaves: sheaths reddish; basal leaves (persisting for several seasons,) reddish, exceeding inflorescence to as short as cauline leaves, glabrous; cauline leaves 2--3, reddish, rarely to 6 cm, often reaching or exceeding inflorescence, glabrous. Inflorescences: glomerules 1--4, pedunculate; main branches 1--3(--4), arching in 1 direction, 1--4 cm, terminated by 2--several peduncles each bearing 1--5 flowers; peduncles 2 mm; ; proximal inflorescence bract usually inconspicuous, though variable in size and shape; bracts and bracteoles conspicuous, clear to deep brown, margins lacerate to fimbriate to abundantly ciliate. Flowers: tepals dark brown with clear apex, 1.6--2.6 mm; outer whorl longer than inner whorl; anthers ca. 2 times filament length; stigmas much exceeding styles. Capsules dark brown, ovoid, Â± equaling to shorter than tepals. Seeds dark brown, (with tuft of fine tangled hairs), ellipsoid, 0.8--1.2 mm. 2n = 36.</description><discussion>Basal leaves and cauline leaves (numbering 2 or 3) are reddish and glabrous in Luzula confusa. Inflorescences have 1--3(--4) main branches terminated by 2--several peduncles, each bearing 1--5 flowers. The flowers are characterized by stigmas that much exceed the styles in length.</discussion><phenology>Flowering and fruiting late summer</phenology><habitat> Wet, exposed rocky and sandy hillsides, lichen tundra, and mountain summits</habitat><habitat>growing where it may be practically only vascular plant</habitat><habitat>circumpolar</habitat><elevation>500--1300 m</elevation><global_distribution>Greenland</global_distribution><ca_distribution>B.C.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Man.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Nfld. and Labr.
