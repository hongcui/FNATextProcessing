F. Cook) Read, is thought to comprise two varieties distributed in Cuba, the Bahamas, and Hispaniola (R. W. Read 1968). Read now thinks that perhaps none of these subspecies or varieties should be maintained (C. Lippincott 1992).</discussion><discussion>For an excellent account of the history of this palm in the Florida Keys and modern efforts to restore this species to habitats that it originally occupied, see C.
