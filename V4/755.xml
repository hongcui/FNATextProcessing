It shares a similar morphology with the diploid A. linearis, with which it has been confused. That entity is present in the south California vicinity of both varieties macilenta and laciniata. It differs in its very slender branchlets, less laciniate wings, and more elongate, elliptic leaves.</discussion></treatment>
