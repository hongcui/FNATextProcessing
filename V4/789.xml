Stems erect to ascending, branched from base; branches arcuate or, occasionally, almost prostrate. Leaves alternate; blade linear, mostly 1–2 mm wide in herbarium specimens, fleshy, usually not swollen at base, apex ± acuminate into rather firm, 1–1.5(–2.2) mm spine. Inflorescences interrupted at maturity, usually 1-flower per axil of bract; bracts alternate, not imbricate at maturity, reflexed, not distinctly swollen at base, apex narrowing into subulate spine. Flowers: bracteoles free or becoming connate and adnate to perianth base; perianth segments with comparatively narrow wing or in lower flowers occasionally wingless (in S. kali subsp. pontica sometimes prominently winged), with weak or firm, acute apex, glabrous; fruiting perianth 4–6(–8) mm diam. 2n = 36.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Subspecies ca. 2 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><introduced>introduced;</introduced><global_distribution>coastal areas of Europe</global_distribution><global_distribution>n Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution>sw Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution>introduced and naturalized in other coastal regions.</global_distribution><key><key_statement>
