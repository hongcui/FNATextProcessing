    <description>Trees, 3–6 m; trunk to 30–45 cm diam. Stem segments green, broadly oblong to ovate
        to narrowly elliptic, (20–)4–60 × 2–3+ cm, low tuberculate; areoles 7–11 per diagonal row
        across midstem segment, rhombic to subcircular, 2–4(–5) mm diam.; wool brown. Spines 1–6 per
        areole, absent or very highly reduced, or in marginal to nearly all areoles, erect to
        spreading, whitish, tan, or brown, setaceous only or setaceous and subulate, straight to
        slightly curved, basally angular-flattened, 1–10(–40) mm; 0–2 small bristlelike deflexed
        spines to 5 mm. Glochids along adaxial margin of areole and small, inconspicuous tuft,
        yellowish, aging brown, less than 2 mm. Flowers: inner tepals yellow to orange throughout,
        25–50 mm; filaments and anthers yellow; style bright red; stigma lobes yellow. Fruits yellow
        to orange to purple, 50–100 × 40–90 mm, fleshy to ± juicy, glabrous, usually spineless;
        areoles 45–60, evenly distributed on fruit. Seeds pale tan, subcircular, 4–5 mm diam.,
        warped; girdle protruding to 1 mm. 2n = 88.</description>

    <discussion>Opuntia ficus-indica, cultivated nearly worldwide, is presumed to be a native of
        Mexico, but is definitely known only from cultivation or escapes from cultivation. The
        species has been used for cattle feed, ornament, and fuel. As human food, the young stem
        segments, “nopalitos,” are eaten as salad or pickled as a vegetable, and the large delicious
        fruits, “tunas,” are enjoyed in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.</discussion>
    <discussion>This species probably originated through selection by native peoples of Mexico for
        spineless forms of Opuntia streptacantha (also 2n = 88) to ease the culturing and collection
        of cochineal scale insects for their red dye. Numerous cultivar names are
        known.</discussion>
    <discussion>Naturalized Opuntia ficus-indica (octoploid, spiny morphotype) is known to hybridize
        in central California with O. phaeacantha (hexaploid), forming a heptaploid with usually
        intermediate morphology.</discussion>
