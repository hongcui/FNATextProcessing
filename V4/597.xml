Scott</section_authority></TaxonIdentification><description>Herbs and subshrubs, annual or perennial, glabrous or densely tomentose-sericeous. Stems erect, ascending, or prostrate, simple or branched, not jointed, not armed, not fleshy; branches alternate [proximal sometimes almost opposite]. Leaves alternate [rarely proximal almost opposite], sessile (sometimes narrowed into pseudopetiole); blade obovate-lanceolate, lanceolate, linear, or filiform, flat or semiterete, base truncate, margins entire, apex rounded. Inflorescences terminal, spicate or paniculately branched; flowers solitary or in 2–5-flowered clusters in axils of bracts; bracts leaflike. Flowers bisexual or pistillate, sessile; perianth segments 5, with horizontal, membranous wing [sometimes reduced to slightly winged tubercles] adaxially; stamens 5; stigmas 2–3. Fruiting structures: perianth covering utricles at maturity, utricles compressed-spheric or compressed-elliptic; pericarp free or nearly so, membranous. Seeds wedge-shaped; seed coat dull brown, slightly ribbed; embryo annular; perisperm copious. x = 9.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 13–16 (3 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>North America</global_distribution><global_distribution>Eurasia</global_distribution><global_distribution>Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution>some species nearly worldwide (as introduced).</global_distribution><discussion>Kochia occurs mostly in steppe, desert, and semidesert zones.</discussion><references>
