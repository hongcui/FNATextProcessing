  <description>Shrubs, vinelike, scandent, terrestrial, hemi-epiphytic, epiphytic, or epipetric,
    sparingly to abundantly branched, branches clustered at nodes. Roots diffuse or adventitious
    along stems. Stems segmented or unsegmented, usually bright green or bluish green to purplish,
    slender cylindric [flattened and leaflike in some epiphytic species], 100–500 × 0.8–5[–30] cm,
    glabrous; ribs [3–]4–8[–12] [or 2-winged in some epiphytic species], prominent and acute to low
    and rounded, rib crests straight to somewhat undulate [toothed, notched, or if stems winged and
    leaflike, then conspicuously lobed]; areoles [10–]15–25[–60] mm apart along ribs, small,
    orbicular, woolly with short white hairs, areolar glands absent; cortex thin and somewhat
    mucilaginous in thicker stems, pith usually not mucilaginous. Spines 1–18 per areole [absent on
    adult stems of epiphytic species], yellow, blackish, or brown [white, greenish, or reddish],
    lateral on stems, bristles hairlike, acicular, or conic, 1–15[–20] mm, soft to hard; radial
    spines [0–]1–18, straight to twisted, usually more slender and flexible than central spines;
    central spines [0–]1[–4] per areole, often not distinguishable from radials, straight [to bent],
    1[–15] mm. Flowers nocturnal, lateral on stems, often fragrant, with long tube [tube essentially
    absent in S. innesii], funnelform to salverform, 12–40 × 8–20 cm; outer tepals usually widely
    spreading when fully open, yellow, orange, brownish, or greenish [to red or purple], linear to
    narrowly oblanceolate; inner tepals ascending to spreading when fully open, white [rarely
    colored], broad; areoles minutely scaly (scales absent in S. spinulosus) with hairs and bristles
    or spines; spines acicular or flexible, hairlike; stigma lobes 10–20, white to yellowish,
    usually long. Fruits usually red, spheric or oblong to ovoid, 5–9 cm, fleshy, hairs and bristles
    deciduous; scales, if present, minute, not conspicuous. Seeds black, ovoid to reniform, shiny. x

  <discussion>Whether populations of Selenicereus in the flora are maintained solely by vegetative
    means or are also reproducing sexually remains unclear. The population biology of the each
    species and its long-term persistence in the flora need to be evaluated.</discussion>
  <discussion>E. F. Anderson (2001), following recommendations from the consensus classification of
    the International Organization for Succulent Plant Study, included epiphytic species in
    Selenicereus, such as those formerly classified within Mediocactus, Deamia, and Strophocactus.
    Many species in the expanded genus remain poorly known.</discussion>
