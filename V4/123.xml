Inflorescences: peduncle longer than subtending petiole; bracts broadly lanceolate, ovate, obovate, or almost round, 5–10 × 3–10 mm, scarious, apex acute, obutse, or rounded, glandular-puberulent; flowers 15–25. Perianth: tube greenish, 7–11 mm, limb white, 3 mm diam. Fruits broadly turbinate, 5–7 × 3–5 mm, scarious, apex truncate and slightly beaked; wings (3–)5, dilated distally and ± flattened perpendicular to plane of lamina, dilations ± as long as wide, thin walled, cavities extending throughout.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>gypseous sandy or gravelly soils</habitat><habitat>open areas</habitat><habitat>among sparse shrubs</habitat><elevation>1700 m;</elevation><us_distribution>N.Mex.</us_distribution><discussion>As far as is known, Abronia bolackii is restricted to gypseous lenses of the Ojo Alamo Formation in San Juan County, New Mexico.</discussion></treatment>
