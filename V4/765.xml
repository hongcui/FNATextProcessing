  <discussion>Species ca. 15 (3 in the flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>Sarcocornia is taxonomically difficult and has never been the subject of a taxonomic
    revision for the Northern Hemisphere. Although it is possible to identify dry specimens to some
    extent, by comparison, it is impossible to obtain from dried specimens data that can be used in
    a taxonomic revision. Characters that may be taxonomically useful are lost on drying, especially
    flower and inflorescence characters and those derived from the fleshy vegetative segments. Habit
    appears to be useful, but few specimen labels note the habit of the living plant, and the parts
    collected rarely allow for a reliable determination of habit. Some species, such as S. perennis
    are prostrate, with the woody stems readily rooting in the substrate. Others such as S. pacifica
    are procumbent to erect shrubs in which the woody stems usually do not root. This apparently
    obvious habit difference is sometimes confounded by external factors, erect species becoming
    procumbent due to water movement, trampling, or burial by silt or sand deposits. Conversely,
    prostrate rooting species can be disturbed by erosion and appear to be procumbent plants of a
    nonrooting species.</discussion>
  <discussion>One of the most useful characters, the indumentum on the testa of the seeds, is rarely
    present in dried specimens because of the lateness of the plants’ flowering season. Plants
    collected in August and September rarely have even immature seeds present, so most herbarium
    specimens do not display this character.</discussion>
  <discussion>The consequence of these problems is that most accounts of Sarcocornia in North
    America recognize only one species, frequently using the name Salicornia virginica Linnaeus for
    the collective entity. The type specimens of S. virginica were collected by John Clayton,
    presumably from Virginia, which are immature annuals and not flowering. The name S. virginica
    cannot be applied to a species in this genus.</discussion>
