    <description>Stems erect to ascending, usually much-branched, 0.2–0.7(–10) dm, densely farinose.
        Leaves non-aromatic; petiole 0.5–2(–3) cm, shorter than or equaling leaf blades; blade ovate
        to rhombic-ovate, 1–3.5(–4.5) × 1–3(–4) cm, base broadly cuneate to abruptly truncate,
        distinctly 3-lobed, margins dentate to ± entire, apex obtuse (rarely subacute), grayish,
        usually densely farinose on both surfaces. Inflorescences glomerules in terminal and lateral
        compound spikes, 2–19 cm; glomerules subglobose, 3–4 mm diam.; bracts absent. Flowers:
        perianth segments 5, distinct nearly to base; lobes ovate, ca. 1 × 1.1 mm, apex obtuse,
        densely farinose, keeled, covering fruit at maturity; stamens 5; stigmas 2, 0.2 mm. Utricles
        depressed-ovoid; pericarp nonadherent, smooth to indistinctly granulate. Seeds lenticular to
        compressed-subglobose, 0.8–1.25 mm diam.; seed coat black, smooth or faintly reticulate. 2n

    <discussion>Many previous reports of Chenopodium opulifolium in North America were based on
        misidentifications. Determining its present occurrence and exact distribution in the New
        World requires special study.</discussion>
