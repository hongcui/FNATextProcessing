Leaves nonaromatic; petiole to 1 cm; blade lanceolate to oblong or ovate, 0.5–4 × 0.3–1.5 cm, base cuneate, margins undulate-dentate, teeth obtuse or acute, apex obtuse or acute, densely farinose, glaucous abaxially. Inflorescences glomerules in terminal or lateral spikes, 5–10 cm; glomerules subglobose, 1.8–2.5 mm diam.; bracts leaflike in inflorescence, elliptic, 0.2–1 × 0.1–0.5 cm, or absent at least in terminal 1/2 of inflorescence. Flowers: perianth segments 3–4; lobes obovate to oblong, 0.5–0.7 × 0.4–0.5 mm, apex obtuse, rounded, not keeled, covering fruit at maturity; stamen 1; stigmas 2. Utricles ovoid; pericarp nonadherent, smooth. Seeds mostly horizontal, some vertical, margins rounded; vertical seeds ovoid to round, 0.6–1.1 mm diam.; horizontal seeds round, 0.6–1.1 mm diam.; seed coat reddish brown, rugose-punctate. 2n = 18.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Varieties 3 or more (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>North America</global_distribution><global_distribution>Asia.</global_distribution><discussion>Several entities (segregate species, subspecies, varieties, and forms) have been described within the Chenopodium glaucum group. Most of the taxa represent morphological traits of individual or ecological variability and have little or no taxonomic importance. However, several entities are well delimited geographically. The native North American taxon is recognized here as a separate variety.</discussion><key><key_statement>
