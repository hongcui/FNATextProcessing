    <discussion>This subgenus is represented widely in both the old and new world species of the genus.
        in north america there are both indigenous and introduced members. however, even the species
        indigenous to the new world have affinities with those from either europe or australia. the
        members are mainly cool-temperate species with some of the introduced species occasionally extending into the warm-temperate
        regions</discussion>
