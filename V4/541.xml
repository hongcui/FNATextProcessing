    <description>Stems erect, simple (or branched), 1–1.5(–10) dm, sparsely farinose. Leaves
        nonaromatic; petiole 0.4–0.7 cm; blade ovate-lanceolate, 3-veined, (1–)1.4–2.4(–4) ×
        (0.05–)0.5–1.1(–2) cm, base cuneate, margins entire or with 1–2 teeth below middle (several
        teeth), apex acute to acuminate, farinose. Inflorescences glomerules in terminal and lateral
        spikes, 2.5–5(–7) cm; glomerules ± spread out, maturing nearly the same time; bracts
        unknown. Flowers: perianth segments 5, distinct nearly to base; lobes elliptic or narrowly
        ovate, 0.7–1 × 0.5–0.7 mm, apex acute, keeled, farinose, covering fruit at maturity; stamens
        5; stigmas 2, length unknown. Achenes or occasionally utricles ovoid; pericarp adherent,

    <discussion>It has been suggested that Chenopodium foggii is a depauperate form of C.
        standleyanum. We believe that the citations for the upper Midwest represent either C.
        standleyanum or C. pratericola. Material from New England of C. foggii, while rare, does
        appear distinct because of its keeled perianth segments and sparse farinose hairs as well as
        its narrowly ovate to ovate leaves and smaller inflorescence.</discussion>
