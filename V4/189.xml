  <discussion>The monogeneric Pereskioideae is the smallest North American subfamily of Cactaceae. Recently, subfam. Maihuenioideae P. Fearn, of South America, was segregated on the basis of DNA and morphologic data. It has long been generally accepted that the cactus family had its origin in a Pereskia-like ancestor, because species of Pereskia, with their broad leaves, woody, barely succulent habits, and relatively primitive-looking flowers, more closely resemble typical, leafy dicotyledonous plants than succulent cacti (A. C. Gibson and P. S. Nobel 1986; B. E. Leuenberger 1986). In addition, species of Pereskia are reported to have the C3 photosynthetic pathway, unlike stem-succulent cacti, which have crassulacean acid metabolism (A. C. Gibson and P. S. Nobel 1986). Recent analyses of DNA data confirm that Pereskia have DNA sequences that are primitive for the family (R. S. Wallace and A. C. Gibson 2002).</discussion>
