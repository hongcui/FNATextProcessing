B. E. Leuenberger (1986) showed the species only as cultivated in Florida; however, it is reported from Highlands and Hillsborough counties, where it may now be established. At Hillsborough County, sizeable clumps were reported growing in a pasture (R. P. Wunderlin, pers. comm.).</discussion></treatment>
