    <discussion>Chenopodium rubrum was selected as the type of Chenopodium by N. L. Britton and A.
        Brown (1913). Following that typification, this should be sect. Chenopodium. Chenopodium
        album was proposed as the lectotype of the genus by A. S. Hitchcock and M. L. Green (1929).
        It is now the “standing type” of the genus (W. Greuter et al. 1993; C. Jarvis et al. 1993),
        and we agree with that decision (S. L. Mosyakin and S. E. Clemants 1996). While acceptance
        of C. rubrum as the type would have no real consequences for our treatment here, this
        species has occasionally been placed in the genus Blitum (a segregate of Chenopodium), and
        if new evidence should suggest that this latter treatment should be followed then
        nomenclatural havoc would occur.</discussion>
