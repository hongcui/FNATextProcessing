  <description type="morphology">Herbs, annual or perennial, finely pubescent, often somewhat viscid; taproot slender
    and soft to stout and woody (depending on duration). Stems procumbent, often clambering through
    other vegetation, unarmed, without glutinous bands on internodes. Leaves paired, petiolate,
    unequal, blades thin, base ± asymmetric. Inflorescences axillary, pedunculate, clusters of 3
    simultaneously blooming flowers resembling single flower; bracts persistent, not accrescent, 3,
    forming involucre, distinct, broadly ovate, cucullate, thin, translucent. Flowers bisexual,
    chasmogamous; perianth strongly bilaterally symmetric, funnelform but strongly oblique,
    constricted beyond ovary, gradually expanded, adaxial lobes minute, abaxially forming a
    fan-shaped limb; stamens 4–7, ± exserted; styles exserted beyond stamens; stigmas capitate.
    Fruits oblong to somewhat obovate, dorsoventrally compressed (adaxial face convex, internal, in
    inflorescence), with 5 strongly modified ribs, central adaxial rib an inconspicuous to
    pronounced rib or ridge, sometimes toothed, keeled, coriaceous; 2 lateral ribs expanded and
    incurved toward concave side as wings or teeth; 2 ribs on concave surface forming low, thin
    ridge, often with teeth that usually bear glands at tip, surface glabrous, and smooth or the
    adaxial slightly rugose.</description>

  <discussion>Species 2 (2 in the flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>The two species of Allionia are very similar, differing primarily in the nature and
    number of teeth on the fruit. In many floras for areas south of the United States only a single
    species, Allionia incarnata, is recognized. When sympatric, the two species are distinguishable
    by vegetative and perianth features, but throughout their ranges, the two species cannot be
    consistently distinguished by the same characteristics. Nevertheless, as noted by B. L. Turner
    (1994), plants with intergradient fruits are uncommon. Both species may produce fruits with
    lateral ribs that are curved and winglike, without teeth; this condition is frequent in A.
    incarnata in North America and occasional in A. choisyi in South America.</discussion>
  <discussion>The three bilaterally symmetric flowers in the Allionia inflorescence bloom
    synchronously and are sufficiently closely situated that the entire inflorescence resembles a
    single radially symmetric flower. The fruit is among the most complex in the family. The convex
    side, oriented toward the center of the cluster of three flowers, exudes copious mucilage when
    wetted. The viscid glands on the concave surface remain sticky for decades in the
    herbarium.</discussion>
