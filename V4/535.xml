    <description>Stems erect, simple or rarely branched, 3–10 dm, glabrous. Leaves nonaromatic;
        petiole 1.5–3.5 cm; blade mostly triangular or rhombic in proximal leaves, triangular,
        rhombic, or lanceolate in distal leaves, 3–11 × 3–10 cm, base truncate to broadly cuneate,
        margins sinuate to dentate (occasionally ± entire), often with obtuse to acute
        outward-pointing lobes at base, apex obtuse to acute, glabrous. Inflorescences glomerules in
        terminal panicles and lateral spikes or compound spikes, 3–4.5(–8) cm; glomerules
        subglobose, 2–3.5 mm diam.; bracts absent. Flowers: perianth segments 5, distinct nearly to
        base; lobes broadly ovate to elliptic, 0.6–0.8 × 0.4–0.8 mm, apex obtuse or retuse, rounded
        or with slight broad keel abaxially, glabrous, only slightly covering fruit at maturity;
        stamens 5; stigmas 2, 0.1 mm. Utricles depressed-ovoid; pericarp nonadherent, papillose to
        smooth. Seeds rarely few vertical, lenticular, round, 0.8–1.2 mm diam.; seed coat black
        (reddish brown), shiny.</description>

    <discussion>Judging from its leaf morphology and anatomy, inflorescence structure, and floral
        characteristics, Chenopodium urbicum probably should be transferred to subg. Blitum, where
        it would occupy a position transitional toward subg. Chenopodium. Two rather distinct
        varie-ties are usually recognized: var. urbicum (= C. deltoideum Lamarck) with triangular
        leaf blades truncate at base, and var. intermedium (Mertens &amp; Koch) Koch [= var.
        rhombifolium (Muhlenberg ex Willdenow) Moquin-Tandon] with rhombic leaf blades cuneate at
        base. Both entities occur in North America.</discussion>
    <discussion>Chenopodium urbicum has been reported from several other provinces and states
        including British Columbia, New Brunswick, Louisiana, Oregon, and Washington. We have not
        been able to verify these locations.</discussion>
