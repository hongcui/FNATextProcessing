The cristae rise and fall not only within populations but on individual plants, as pointed out by H. M. Hall and F. E. Clements (1923), and apparently lack taxonomic value. A sterile collection from Brewster County, Texas (B. H. Warnock 409-T), has long-attenuate leaf bases, the expanded portion of the blade spatulate-oblanceolate to oval. It is tentatively placed here, but might represent some species from south of the Mexican border.</discussion><discussion>Specimens of the “thornberi” phase, collected by Thornber, are present at UC: Santa Cruz Valley, Tucson, 16 Aug 1910, J. J. Thornber s.n., 2 sheets. At least some portion of the material by Thornber is possibly the type material for var. thornberi, but there is no indication on the sheets that they were seen by Jones.</discussion></treatment>
