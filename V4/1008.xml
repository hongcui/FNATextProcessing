It is very similar to, and perhaps should be merged with, P. validulus, from which it differs mainly in having much shorter peduncles. When originally described, P. thompsonii was thought to differ also in having fewer stamens and longer leaves and petals, but in fact P. validulus sometimes has as few as six stamens, and has maximum leaf and petal lengths greater than those found in P. thompsonii.</discussion></treatment>
