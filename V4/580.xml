  <discussion>Reports of populations in Canada and inland areas of the United States appear to be
        from gardens where the plants do not persist without benefit of cultivation.</discussion>
  <discussion>Spinach is an important and widely cultivated crop of unknown origin, though known
        from the Mediterranean region since ancient times. The plant is prized as a rich source of
        vitamins, calcium, iron, and antioxidant carotenoids, but, if ingested in excessive amounts,
        the high concentration of oxalates in the leaves can be toxic by inhibiting the absorption
        of calcium. The cultivated form named var. oleracea has spiny seeds and tends to be more
        cold hardy than var. inermis, the smooth-seeded variety that is more tolerant of warm
        weather.</discussion>
