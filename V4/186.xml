A. Munz (1974). The taxon in question is Malephora crocea (Jacquin) Schwantes (W. R. Ferren Jr. et al. 1981). Drosanthemum speciosum is cultivated as an ornamental in California; it is not known to naturalize. For an illustration of Drosanthemum speciosum see H. Herre (1971). Drosanthemum is closely related to Delosperma though the latter genus lacks membranes covering the seeds.</discussion></treatment>
