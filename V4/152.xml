    <description>Shrubs or small trees, to 6 m; branches dense, spreading at right angles, usually
        armed with stout, recurved spines 7–14 mm. Stems arching, velvety when young, glabrate
        later. Leaf blades broadly obovate or suborbiculate, 2–6 × 2–6 cm, base rounded or broadly
        cuneate, apex rounded, rarely subacute. Inflorescences: [staminate inflorescences
        subglobose, dense, 1–2 cm diam.]; pistillate inflorescences densely subglobose at anthesis,
        more open in age; branches divaricate or ascending; fruiting pedicel 0.5–2 cm. Perianths:
        [perianth of staminate flowers deep red, broadly campanulate, 2–3 mm, densely and shortly
        viscid-villous]; perianth of pistillate flowers greenish, often blushed with red, 2–2.5 mm,
        densely puberulent. Fruits clavate, 7–10 × 3–4 mm, densely puberulent between glandular
        ribs, glands extending entire length of fruits.</description>

    <discussion>Pisonia capitata is represented in the flora by a single, possibly clonal,
        population of a few pistillate plants in south-central Arizona several hundred kilometers
        north of known populations in Sonora, perhaps originating from a freak event of bird
        dispersal. Plants are not known to have set seed.</discussion>
    <discussion>As noted above, pistillate plants of Pisonia capitata and P. aculeata exhibit no
        apparent differences, nor are there apparent vegetative differences between the species.
        That plants known in the flora truly represent P. aculeata is an assumption based on
        geography.</discussion>
