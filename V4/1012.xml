        leaves 5–7. Flowers 20–25 mm diam.; petals connate basally, purple-red, narrowly
        obovate-cuneate, 10–12 × 6–9 mm, apex deeply 2-lobed; stamens 40 or more; stigmas 4–6(–7).

    <discussion>Portulaca biloba, previously known only from Cuba, is presently known from five
        sites in three Georgia counties. The infrequency of chasmogamous flowers suggests that it is
        “out of habitat.” The earliest collection is from 1965, but the date of its first
        introduction to the United States is unknown. One theory of introduction suggests seeds
        brought in by tropical storms (J. F. Matthews et al. 1991).</discussion>
