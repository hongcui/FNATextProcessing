K. Godfrey (1961). In habit and especially inflorescence type, the plant is decidedly unlike other members of the Phytolaccaceae in the flora area. It bears a superficial resemblance to Mollugo verticillata Linnaeus of the Aizoaceae.</discussion><discussion>In the flora, plants with achene sutures obscurely toothed are var. pharnacioides; plants with sutures frequently expanded into prominent whitish dorsiventral crests or wings are var. alata M. G. Gilbert, known from Arabia, Iran, and Pakistan (M. G. Gilbert 1993).</discussion><discussion>The specific epithet is sometimes misspelled “pharnaceoides.”</discussion></treatment>
