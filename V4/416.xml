    <description>Plants unbranched or less often few branched (rarely forming mounds to [30–]40 cm
        diam.), spines not much obscuring stem surface. Roots ± diffuse. Stems spheric or ovoid
        (cylindric in old plants), deep-seated only when young, sometimes flat-topped, 5–15(–25) ×
        5.5–8.5(–15) cm; tubercles (10–)15–30(–40) × 8–15 mm, firm; areolar glands seasonally
        conspicuous; parenchyma not mucilaginous; pith 1/3–1/2 of lesser stem diam.; medullary
        vascular system present. Spines 7–20+ per areole, usually whitish, straw colored or horn
        colored to grayish tan, sometimes pale pinkish gray when fresh, tips dark red to dark brown,
        larger spines often extensively tipped chestnut, blackish purple, or black; radial spines
        6–16(–20) per areole (commonly 5–7 on immature plants), 11–35 mm, nearly as large as the
        central spines, often longer, 0.8–1.2 mm diam.; subcentral spines 0–2 per areole; central
        spines 1–4 per areole (0–1 on immature plants), abaxial (or only) spine porrect or slightly
        ascending, larger spines rigid, straight on older plants in eastern populations (strongly
        curved and/or hooked in some immature plants and young adults of western populations), one
        23–34 mm, others, if present, 12–50 × 0.3–2 mm. Flowers nearly apical, (38–)45–64 ×
        (32–)50–73 mm; outer tepals minutely fringed; inner tepals ca. 20 per flower, dark golden
        yellow, pale greenish yellow, translucent dull yellow, or saffron yellow, proximally
        reddish, often bronze tinted proximally or in vague midstripes, sometimes turning entirely
        pinkish bronze, 23–36 × 5–11.5 mm; outer filaments reddish or orange; anthers pale to bright
        yellow; stigma lobes 6–11, cream to creamy pink, yellow, or orange-yellow, 3–7 mm. Fruits
        green, fusiform-cylindric, (35–)40–50 × (12–)13(–15) mm, slimy; floral remnant deciduous,
        leaving a concave abscission scar. Seeds bright reddish brown, narrowly reniform-cylindric
        to reniform-obovoid or comma-shaped, 2.3–3.5 mm, smooth, shiny (anticlinal cell walls
        forming a conspicuous reticulate color-pattern, but not visibly protruding). 2n =

    <discussion>Coryphantha robustispina appears to be a cline from robust western plants to smaller
        eastern plants. Western populations, especially C. robustispina in the strict sense, are the
        most robust in the species, and central spines of their immature plants are always hooked.
        Rarely, the spines are hooked at all ages. Southeastern populations of C. robustispina are
        smaller in all parts and produce only straight central spines throughout their lives. They
        were the original basis of Mammillaria scheeri Muehulenpfordt, an illegitimate later
        homonym. Specimens (syntypes) upon which C. scheeri var. valida (Schott ex Engelmann) L. D.
        Benson (as M. scheeri var. valida) was based were a mixture of both.</discussion>
    <discussion>L. D. Benson (1969c) described C. scheeri var. uncinata based on an unusual specimen
        of the widespread form in southern New Mexico and adjacent regions.</discussion>
    <discussion>Coryphantha robustispina characteristically occurs at such low density that casual
        exploration rarely discloses more than one or two plants per location. Sampling error seems
        responsible for most of the reported differences between the purported varieties; this is
        especially true with respect to floral characters. Tepal color and flower shape, for
        example, vary equally in each of the “varieties.”</discussion>
    <discussion>Young adult plants of Ancistrocactus brevihamatus with some elongate areoles and
        poorly defined ribs might key to Coryphantha robustispina, but Ancistrocactus has different
        seeds and broad bracteoles.</discussion>
    <discussion>Coryphantha robustispina is in the Center for Plant Conservation’s National
        Collection of Endangered Plants.</discussion>
