Stems often reddish, 0.1–1.5 m. Leaves progressively reduced distally; distal leaves proportionately narrower than proximal; larger leaves: petiole 2–25 mm, equaling or shorter than blade; blade usually flat, sometimes undulate, 20–65 × 10–35 mm, base often oblique, obtuse, or round, margins entire or sinuate, apex acute, sometimes obtuse or round. Inflorescences: peduncle 3–25(–30) mm, involucres ovoid when mature, 4–6.5(–9) mm. Perianth deep pink to magenta, 5–15 mm. Fruits deeply convex, 2.9–4.7 × 1.5–2.8 mm; lateral ribs with 0–4 teeth, teeth usually broadly (rarely narrowly) triangular, never gland tipped, or edge of fruit wings entire or with only irregular undulations and incisions, concave side of fruit with 4–7 glands per row (glands rarely continuous or 2 rows glandless); stalks equaling or shorter than diameter of glandular head.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Varieties 2 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>North America</global_distribution><global_distribution>Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution>West Indies</global_distribution><global_distribution>Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution>South America.</global_distribution><discussion>Allionia incarnata was used by indigenous peoples to treat swellings, was added to baths to reduce fever, and also prepared as a decoction to treat diarrhea and kidney ailments (S. Cheatham et al. 1995, vol. 1). Occasionally fruits of A. incarnata are shallowly convex and resemble, in this respect, the fruits of A. choisyi.</discussion><key><key_statement>
