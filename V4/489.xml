    <description>Plants annual or perennial. Leaf blades with margins entire to pinnatifid.
        Inflorescences linear-spicate or spicate-paniculate, ± foliose with flowers clustered in
        dense glomerules. Flowers: perianth segments (3–)4–5, connate basally; stamens 4–5; styles
        (2–)3(–5). Seeds mostly horizontal (vertical in D. chilensis, sometimes vertical in D.
        ambrosioides and D. anthelmintica).</description>

    <discussion>Several researchers have treated this section as having a single, highly polymorphic
        species, Dysphania ambrosioides sensu lato (Chenopodium ambrosioides). Others recognize
        between two and twelve species (P. Aellen 1929, 1960–1961; P. Aellen and T. Just 1943; V. N.
        Voroschilov 1942; L. E. Simón 1996, 1997; L. Giusti 1997). We feel that the following four
        species represent good taxa. There are additional taxa or variations in North America that
        have not been accounted for here. In particular, the variation in leaf and bract shape and
        bract size have not been fully recognized. Most of this variation would fall within our
        concept of D. ambrosioides.</discussion>
