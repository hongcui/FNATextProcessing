  <discussion>Chenopodium ficifolium has often been called C. serotinum Linnaeus. P. Aellen
        (1929b) and P. Uotila (1979b) have shown that the type of C. serotinum is a sterile Atriplex
        specimen (most probably A. tatarica Linnaeus) based on its Kranz-type leaf structure.
        Chenopodium blomianum Aellen [= C. ficifolium subsp. blomianum (Aellen) Aellen] was
        described from Sweden based on alien plants of presumably East Asian origin (P. Aellen
        1928). According to Aellen, that subspecies occurs in southern and southeastern Asia and
        differs from C. ficifolium subsp. ficifolium in having leaves with spreading basal lobes
        almost perpendicular to the central lobe and seeds with shallow elongate depressions. All
        North American plants of C. ficifolium belong to subsp. ficifolium. In Europe C. ficifolium
        occasionally hybridizes with other species, including C. album (producing C. ×zahnii Murr)
        and C. suecicum (producing C. ×gruellii Aellen). No study has been made of such hybrids in
        North America.</discussion>
