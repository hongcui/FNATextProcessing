  <description>Plants typically dioecious, woody, low to tall. Leaves with Kranz anatomy, usually
    alternate, petiolate or sessile; blade variously shaped, margin entire, hastately lobed, or
    variously dentate. Staminate flowers in axillary glomerules or more typically in naked terminal
    spikes or spicate panicles. Pistillate flowers lacking perianth. Fruiting bracteoles sessile or
    stipitate, united beyond middle to apex, variously shaped, winged or wingless, margin entire or
    toothed to lobed, faces tuberculate or lacking tubercles. Seeds erect; radicle superior or
    sublateral (in A. hymenelytra, A. lentiformis, and A. torreyi).</description>

  <discussion>E. Ulbrich (1934) circumscribed section Deserticola to include all of the shrubby
    species of Atriplex except for Atriplex canescens, which he included within Obione subgenus
    Pterochiton. The name Deserticola was taken by J. McNeill et al. (1983) to include not only A.
    canescens per se, but representatives of other groups containing woody taxa, as treated by P. C.
    Standley. Atriplex canescens is known to form hybrids with numerous other taxa of woody
    Atriplex. Thus, most of the woody species are in some large part closely allied and capable of
    hybridization to a greater or lesser extent. Members of the subgenus, despite their near
    relationships, also show affinities that lead back through time to some ancestor or ancestors
    common to both them and with those of subgenus Obione. They do not, however, appear to have
    arisen as end points of evolution from various places within that subgenus, i.e., the subgenus
    Pterochiton appears to be monophyletic.</discussion>
