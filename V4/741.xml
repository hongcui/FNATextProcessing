  <discussion>This distinctive plant has been regarded as a portion of the variation within an expanded Atriplex canescens, with which it shares the feature of 4-winged, pistillate, fruiting bracteoles, but it is possibly more closely allied with A. confertifolia, with which it hybridizes. However, the plants simulate the growth form of the geographically contiguous A. gardneri var. cuneata, and possibly its affinity lies in that direction.</discussion>
  <discussion>Garrettâ€™s saltbush grows on slopes along the canyons of the Colorado and San Juan rivers, mainly rooted into the fine-textured saline substrates of the Chinle and Moenkop formations, with a thin mantle of sandstone detritus derived from Navajo and Wingate sandstones. Much of the habitat has been inundated by Lake Powell.</discussion>
