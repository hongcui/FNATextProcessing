  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Trees or shrubs, spreading, 2–3 m; trunk, when present, to 30 cm. Stem segments not disarticulating, dark green, flattened, subcircular to broadly obovate, 16–25 × 16–19 cm, nearly smooth, glabrous; areoles 8–10 per diagonal across midstem segment, prominent, subcircular, 4.5–5.5 mm, greatly enlarging to 10 mm diam.; wool tan to gray. Spines 5–13 per areole, in most areoles, usually reflexed, translucent yellow, aging red-brown, angular, curved, subulate, the longest 20–25(–50) mm. Glochids in rather dense crescent along adaxial margins, increasing in length toward base, subapical tuft poorly developed, tan, aging brown, to 6 mm. Flowers: inner tepals yellow throughout, 25–40 mm; filaments yellow to orange-yellow; anthers yellow; style red; stigma lobes green or light green. Fruits red to red-purple, pale yellow inside, with seed pulp red, subspheric to barrel-shaped, 37–60 × 30–45 mm, juicy, glabrous, spineless; areoles 23–63. Seeds gray-brown, subcircular to semicircular, 3.5–4 mm diam.; girdle protruding to 0.4 mm. 2n = 33 (an abnormal, polyhaploid individual), 66.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><habitat>coastal sage scrub</habitat><habitat>coastal chaparral</habitat><elevation>0–500 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.

D. Parfitt and M. A. Baker 1993), likely to be O. littoralis. The hybrid appears to be rather widespread and blurs distinctions between the putative parents.</discussion></treatment>
