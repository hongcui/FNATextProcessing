Stems erect or ascending, branched from base or nearly so; branches straight or slightly arcuate (proximal ones sometimes almost prostrate). Leaves (especially proximal ones) mostly opposite; blade linear, usually more than 1.5 mm wide in herbarium specimens, fleshy, distinctly swollen or ovate at base, apex mucronulate, not spinose. Inflorescences distinctly interrupted, 1-flowered; bracts alternate or almost opposite, not imbricate, horizontally reflexed at maturity, swollen at base, abruptly narrowing into mucronulate nonspinose apex. Flowers: bracteoles distinct, not adnate to perianth segments; perianth segments wingless or with rudimental triangular tubercles at maturity, margins crenate or pectinate-ciliate apically, glabrous; fruiting perianth ca. 3–6(–7) mm diam. 2n = 18.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>coastal and disturbed saline habitats</habitat><elevation>0–50 m;</elevation><introduced>introduced;</introduced><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><global_distribution>Eurasia</global_distribution><global_distribution>n Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution>introduced in South America.</global_distribution><discussion>Salsola soda can be expected to spread in California, or to appear in inland or coastal saline habitats in southern states.</discussion></treatment>
