    <discussion>Atriplex canescens var. gigantea occurs with scurfpea (Psoralidium lanceolatum),
        ricegrass (Stipa hymenoides), and other dune plants. Occasional plants with very large
        bracts occur as far south as El Paso County, Texas. The chromosomal status for Atriplex
        canescens var. gigantea is unknown, however, and is evidently unusual in the species in
        being diploid. The population in Juab County, Texas, occurs in active sand dunes and
        accommodates the change in depth of sand by rooting (i.e., layering) along the buried
        portions of the stem (H. C. Stutz et al. 1975). Actual plant length below the sand surface
        is often much greater than that showing above the surface.</discussion>

        Collection of Endangered Plants.</discussion>
