  <discussion>Most plants of Boerhavia coulteri var. coulteri have fruit apices that are bluntly conic- or round-truncate. Along the Santa Cruz River particularly, some plants have abruptly truncate fruits; those plants represent the phase known as B. rosei. Early in the twentieth century, J. J. Thornber proposed the name “B. standleyi” for such plants but never published it. P. C. Standley (1911) described the ribs of B. rosei as narrow, adding in 1918 that the sulci were broad and open. As the type demonstrates, the relative breadth of the ribs and sulci is exactly the reverse, confusing regional botanists for several generations.</discussion>
