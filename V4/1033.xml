Stems prostrate to erect, branching from base. Leaves whorled, opposite, or alternate; basal leaves usually largest, cauline leaves gradually reduced distally; stipules absent or rudimentary. Inflorescences axillary or terminal, reduced umbellate or cymose. Flowers pedicellate; sepals persistent, 5, distinct, not stellate-pubescent; petals absent; stamens 3–5, alternate with the sepals or carpels, basally connate by a small hypogynous ring; pistils 3–5-locular; ovules 5–15 per locule; styles 3–5, distinct. Fruits capsular, 3-valved. Seeds: flattened laterally, reniform, smooth or reticulate to ribbed, strophioles absent. x = 9.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 35 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>North America</global_distribution><global_distribution>West Indies</global_distribution><global_distribution>Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution>South America</global_distribution><global_distribution>Europe</global_distribution><global_distribution>Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution>Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution>Australia.</global_distribution><discussion>Although Mollugo has little economic value, some species have been used medicinally or as vegetables. Mollugo spergula, which has been used in India as a green vegetable, contains bitter triterpenoid saponins and sometimes is used as a source of antiseptics (A. K. Barua et al. 1989) and has been used also as a potherb (A. K. Tripathi 1988). Antifungal compounds have been isolated from Mollugo pentaphylla (M. Hamburger et al. 1989).</discussion><discussion>The taxonomy of species of Mollugo is in great disarray, and the genus is in need of a thorough worldwide revision.</discussion><discussion>C. F. Reed (1964), in a study of ore-pile flora, listed Mollugo gracillima Andersson and M. nudicaulis Lamarck from Maryland. The former was based on a misidentified specimen of M. verticillata, while the latter was correctly identified, representing the only known report of the species in North America.</discussion><key><key_statement>
