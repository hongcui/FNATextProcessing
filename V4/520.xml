  <discussion>Hybrids between Chenopodium rubrum and C. glaucum are known as C. Ã—schulzeanum Murr
        and have been seen from waste areas in Illinois and Washington. These plants in general
        resemble C. rubrum with small, mealy leaves and horizontal seeds, but they also have some
        leaves shaped like those of C. glaucum.</discussion>
