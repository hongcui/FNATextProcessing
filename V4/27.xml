  <description type="morphology">Herbs, perennial, often ± woody at base; taproot long and ropelike, woody. Stems
        prostrate to decumbent, usually profusely branched throughout, 3–15 dm, minutely pubescent,
        often glandular, sometimes spreading villous or hirsute in basal portions, minutely
        pubescent, sometimes glandular, glabrate, or glabrous distally. Leaves usually distributed
        throughout plant and into much of inflorescence; larger leaves with petiole 5–25 mm, blade
        broadly lanceolate, ovate, or broadly ovate, occasionally ± round, 20–70 × 10–60 mm (distal
        leaves smaller, often proportionally narrower), base truncate, broadly cuneate, or round,
        rarely cordate, margins sinuate, apex acute to obtuse or round, adaxial surface glabrous or
        sometimes sparsely puberulent, rarely densely glandular-pubescent, abaxial surface paler
        than adaxial surface, glabrous or sometimes sparsely puberulent, rarely densely
        glandular-pubescent, often with large multicellular hairs along veins, neither surface
        punctate. Inflorescences axillary or terminal, forked unequally ca. 3–6 times, open, without
        sticky internodal bands; branches divergent, terminating in compact subumbellate or capitate
        5-flowered clusters. Flowers: pedicel shorter than 0.5 mm; bract at base of perianth usually
        quickly deciduous, 1, linear-lanceolate to ovate, 0.5–1 mm; perianth maroon, or magenta (or
        rarely white or yellow) [pink], campanulate beyond constriction, 1–3.5 mm; stamens 2–3,
        slightly exserted. Fruits (2–)5–20(–30) per cluster, gray-brown to brown, narrowly obovate
        and tapering at both ends or clavate, 2.6–4 × 0.9–1.2 mm (l/w: 2.7–3.5), apex rounded to
        rounded-conic, moderately densely to densely stipitate-glandular on ribs and in sulci; ribs
        5, rounded, smooth; sulci 1–2.5 times as wide as base of ribs, not rugose, not papillate. 2n

  <discussion>Boerhavia coccinea is weedy and probably adventive along the Gulf and southern
        Atlantic coasts in North America; it can be expected in waste areas anywhere in that region.
        Worldwide, it probably also has a broader range than indicated, particularly on oceanic
        islands. The complex, which is in need of taxonomic clarification, is extremely variable
        with regard to robustness, pubescence, and fruit number in individual terminal
        inflorescences. In the New World, flowers are usually some shade of deep wine red, although
        populations of white-flowered or yellow-flowered plants are rarely found (R. Spellenberg
        2000). In the Old World, pink-flowered plants are frequent (C. Whitehouse
        1996).</discussion>
