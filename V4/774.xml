Stems branched above bases, glabrous; branches ascending, base fused to subtending leaves for ± 1 mm, glabrous. Leaves ascending or partly appressed to stem, green; blade narrowly linear, planoconvex, 3–20 mm, apex acute. Inflorescences much-branched; branchlets ascending, 1–120 mm, slender; glomes (1–)3(–6)-flowered; bracts similar to leaves, distal ones much shorter, 0.5–10(–20) mm or absent. Perianths obovoid to pyriform, subglobose in fruit, 1–2 × 0.6–1.2 mm; perianth segments erect, connate to 1/2 or 2/3 their length in bisexual flowers, ± completely connate in pistillate flowers, distally hooded, slightly horned near apex; stigmas (2–)3. Seeds dimorphic; subglobose, 1.2–2 mm, with seed coat black, or flat and coiled, 1.75–2.25 mm, with seed coat brownish green.</description><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><phenology>nov</phenology><habitat>alkaline and saline soils</habitat><elevation>1400–1900 m;</elevation><introduced>introduced;</introduced><us_distribution>Nev.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Wyo.</us_distribution><global_distribution>Asia.</global_distribution></treatment>
