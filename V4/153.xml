        occasionally pubsecent along veins, apex rounded to slightly retuse. Inflorescences:
        staminate inflorescences compound cymose to corymbose, 2 cm diam.; pistillate densely
        compound cymose at anthesis, more open in age; branches divaricate or ascending; fruiting
        pedicel 0.5–2 cm. Perianths: perianth of staminate flowers green or white, urceolate, 2–4
        mm; perianth of pistillate flowers greenish, often blushed with red, 3.5–4 mm, densely
