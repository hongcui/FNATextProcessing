  <discussion>Boerhavia triquetra, very narrowly defined here by a predominance of 3- and 4-ribbed fruits, is uncommon in the flora, known to occur only on low deserts near the Colorado River and southward around the Sea of Cortez. The species has few- or 1-flowered terminal inflorescences. Its relationship to, and distinctness from, B. intermedia, needs clarification. In the area of the type locality, Bahia de los Angeles, on the east coast of Baja California, some plants have only 3- and 4-winged fruits, whereas most will have 3-, 4-, and some 5-winged fruits. The five-winged fruits do not differ from those of B. intermedia, a species common on the peninsula. Intergradient plants occur on the peninsula and on islands in the gulf.</discussion>
