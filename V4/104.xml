Leaves usually widely ascending at 60–80°, abruptly reduced below inflorescence; petiole 0–0.9 cm; blade green adaxially, glaucescent abaxially, broadly ovate, ovate-triangular, or round, 4–7 × 3–6 cm, thick, moderately coriaceous, base cordate to round or cuneate, apex obtuse to round, surfaces glabrous or soft hirsute adaxially, soft hirsute abaxially. Inflorescences primarily terminal, few branched, open; peduncle 3–6 mm, spreading-pubescent, sometimes somewhat glandular, crosswalls of hairs pale; involucres grayish green, widely bell-shaped, 4–6 mm in flower, 7–8 mm in fruit, spreading-pubescent, 40–50% connate, lobes ovate. Flowers 3 per involucre; perianth purplish pink, 0.9–1.1 cm. Fruits pale olive brown, narrowly obovoid, 4–5 mm, ± evenly puberulent with hairs 0.1 mm; ribs round, 0.3–0.5 times width of sulci, 0.5 times as wide as high, slightly rugose (more so on side); sulci slightly darker than ribs, slightly rugose.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>open, calcareous, shaley outcrops</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>1600–1700 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Colo.</us_distribution><discussion>Mirabilis rotundifolia is clearly closely related to Mirabilis albida and may be only a variant.</discussion><discussion>Mirabilis rotundifolia is in the Center for Plant Conservation’s National Collection of Endangered Plants.</discussion></treatment>
