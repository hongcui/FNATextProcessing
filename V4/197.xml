    <description>Trees or shrubs, densely branched, 0.5–3 m. Stem segments green, sometimes purple
        tinged, 6–10.5 × 0.5–1.3 cm; tubercles narrowly elongate, appearing as wrinkles when dry,
        1–2 cm; areoles circular, 2–3 mm in diam.; wool tan to brown, aging gray to black. Spines
        0–2(–3) per areole, sparsely distributed along stem, usually deflexed, pale yellow or
        red-brown aging black, stout, the longest 0.8–3.5(–5) cm; sheaths loose fitting, yellowish
        brown. Glochids in adaxial tuft and marginal, encircling areole, pale yellow. Flowers: inner
        tepals green- or orange-bronze, spatulate, 17–20 mm, apiculate; filaments dark green-bronze;
        anthers yellow; style whitish basally to light orange apically; stigma lobes very pale
        green. Fruits green, becoming yellowish apically, sometimes tinged red to purplish at
        areoles, commonly sterile, then narrow, tuberculate, to 2.5 cm, fertile ones stipitate,
        obconic, 20–50 × 15–35 mm, fleshy, becoming smooth, spineless; umbilicus 3–4 mm deep;
        areoles 15–17(–34). Seeds pale yellow, angularly circular to oblong, thick, 3–5 mm diam.,
        lumpy; girdle smooth, broad, not protruding. 2n = 66.</description>

    <discussion>Cylindropuntia arbuscula forms hybrids with C. leptocaulis in south-central Arizona;
        those hybrids have narrow, obscurely tuberculate stems and reddish fruits nearly the size of
        those of C. arbuscula and chromosome number of 2n = 55. Hybrids between C. arbuscula and C.
        spinosior [= C. ×neoarbuscula (Griffiths) F. M. Knuth] have large green fruits, which often
        split open, and on stem segments distal areoles that usually bear three or four spines to
        2.5 cm. Hybrids between C. arbuscula and C. versicolor [= C. ×vivipara (Rose) F. M. Knuth]
        have large green fruits, which often split open, and distal stem segment areoles that bear
        one or two spines to 1.5 cm.</discussion>
