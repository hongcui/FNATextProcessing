Plants with staminate flowers have not previously been discerned from among the general collections of Z. brandegeei, and, indeed, immature or mainly staminate specimens of undetermined provenence are difficult if not impossible to identify from other phases of the species. Previous descriptions of Zuckia and its only species (Z. arizonica) are conspicuous in lacking discussion of staminate features. Supposed differences in vesture between the taxa apparently do not exist, and other diagnostic morphology is unknown. There are broad- and narrow-leaved phases within this variety also, about equivalent to those displayed by the varieties having vertical seeds. No additional taxonomic segregation appears to be possible, however.</discussion><discussion>Distribution of Zuckia brandegeei var. arizonica lies almost entirely within the range of the other two varieties. It is found on the Entrada, Summerville, Morrison, and Duchesne River formations; in eastern Utah; and on other siltstone and mudstone formations in north-central Arizona.</discussion></treatment>
