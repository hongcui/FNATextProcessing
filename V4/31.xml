    <description>Herbs, perennial, sometimes slightly woody at base; taproot long, ropelike, ±
        woody. Stems usually erect or ascending, occasionally decumbent, sparingly branched
        throughout, 2–5(–9) dm, hirsute, puberulent, or glandular basally, hair types often mixed,
        glandular-puberulent, glabrous, or occasionally puberulent and sparsely hispid distally.
        Leaves mostly in basal 2/3 of plant; larger leaves with petiole 1–5 mm, blade lanceolate to
        linear, rarely ovate, 15–35 × 1–15 mm (distal leaves usually longer, narrower), adaxial
        surface glabrous or sparsely hispid, occasionally glandular-pubescent, sometimes punctate,
        abaxial surface usually paler than adaxial, glabrous or sparsely hispid, occasionally
        glandular-pubescent, usually punctate with small patches of large gray to dark brown cells,
        base obtuse, truncate, or rounded, margins entire and revolute, apex usually acute,
        sometimes obtuse or rounded. Inflorescences terminal and axillary, forked ca. 2–4 times
        unequally, open, without sticky internodal bands; branches strongly ascending, terminating
        in loose, 1–few-flowered, cymose clusters. Flowers: pedicel 1–2(–5) mm; bracts at base of
        perianth persistent, 3, lanceolate to ovate-acuminate, 1–2 mm; perianth purplish pink,
        widely funnelform beyond constriction, 4–7 mm; stamens 5(–6), well exserted. Fruits borne
        singly (or 2–3 in open clusters), dark gray-brown, oblong-clavate, 2.5–3.5 × 1.2–1.5 mm
        (l/w: (1.7–)2.1–3.5), apex round, usually glabrous; ribs (4–)5, broadly rounded, smooth,
        edges sharp and slightly overhanging sulcus; sulci about as wide as base of ribs, smooth,
        not papillate (very rarely minutely and sparsely puberulent). 2n = ca. 52.</description>
