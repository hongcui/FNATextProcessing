  <discussion>Specimens of Atriplex canescens var. macilenta resemble A. linearis. The taxa have
        been placed together by some previous workers. Nevertheless, the stems of A. linearis are
        consistently more slender, the leaves proportionally narrower, and the bracts, though
        smaller, more closely simulate those of A. canescens. Its diploid nature signals a different
        evolutionary pathway than that for most of A. canescens, considered broadly. Narrow leaves
        occur within A. canescens, in the broad sense, sometimes with geographic correlation,
        sometimes not.</discussion>
  <discussion>Excluded species:</discussion>
  <discussion>Atriplex barclayana subsp. dilatata H. M. Hall &amp; Clements, Publ. Carnegie Inst.
        Wash. 326: 315. 1923</discussion>
  <discussion>A new species, most related to Atriplex argentea and A. expansa, judging from the
        habit; but the fruits are flat and their sides not appendaged or muricate.” The plant was
        described from San Benito Island, Baja California.</discussion>
  <discussion>Atriplex nitens Schkuhr, Bot. Handb. 3: 541. 1803</discussion>
  <discussion>P. C. Standley (1916) reported this species in New York, New Jersey, South Dakota,
        and Oregon.</discussion>
  <discussion>P. Aellen (1964) wrote: “Like 4 [i.e., A. hortensis] but the leaves white beneath;
        bracteoles oblong-cordate, conspicuously reticulate-veined.” Specimens having at least some
        of the above noted characteristics occur here and there among the North American materials
        of A. hortensis, and the name nitens is here in considered in synonymy of that species. It
        belongs to sect. Atriplex.</discussion>
  <discussion>Atriplex nodosa Greene, Pittonia 1: 40. 1887</discussion>
  <discussion>This name was apparently not taken up, even in synonymy, by either L. Abrams and R.
        S. Ferris (1923–1960, vol. 2) or P. A. Munz (1959), but was cited as a synonym of Atriplex
        argentea by P. C. Standley (1916). H. M. Hall and F. E. Clements (1923) cited this as a
        synonym of “A. argentea expansa,” based on “An insect stung monstrosity, according to Jepson
        (Fl. Calif. 436, 1914).”</discussion>
  <discussion>Atriplex sibirica Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. ed. 2, 2: 1493. 1763</discussion>
  <discussion>This was supposedly collected in northeastern United States, but no specimens have
        been seen from the flora area. It belongs to sect. Obione.</discussion>
  <discussion>Atriplex vesicaria Heward ex Bentham, Fl. Austral. 5: 172. 1870</discussion>
  <discussion>The section Dialysex, to which Atriplex vesicaria belongs, is treated in the
        Australian flora with sixteen species; A. vesicaria with eight subspecies; its records in
        the United States, if any, are not known to me. It would not, in any case, be treated with
        the herbaceous species. H. M. Hall and F. E. Clements (1923) noted that this species, and
        the related A. holocarpa, have both been grown in American gardens with the thought of using
        both of them as forage plants, but neither of them found suitable for general
        planting.</discussion>
