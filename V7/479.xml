  <description>Perennials; (cespitose, pulvinate); caudex often branched (covered with persistent, thickened petioles, branches sometimes terminating in sterile rosettes); scapose. Stems unbranched, (0.04–)0.07–0.5(–0.6) dm, usu-ally pubescent throughout, rarely glabrous distally, tri-chomes simple and 2-rayed, 0.2–0.6 mm, with smaller, dendritic ones. Basal leaves (densely imbricate); rosulate; petiolate; petiole margin ciliate, (trichomes simple and 2-rayed, 0.3–0.8 mm); blade oblanceolate to obovate or nearly linear, 0.2–0.8(–1.1) cm × 1–3 mm, margins entire, (pubescent as abaxial surface), surfaces pubescent abaxially, glabrous adaxially, with simple and stalked, 2-rayed trichomes, 0.3–0.8 mm, sometimes with subdendritic ones, 0.1–0.3 mm, (midvein persistent, strongly thickened). Cauline leaves 0. Racemes 2–8-flowered, ebracteate, (corymbose), slightly elongated in fruit; rachis not flexuous, usually pubescent as stem, (trichomes often crisped), rarely glabrous. Fruiting pedicels horizontal to divaricate, straight, 1–5(–7) mm, usually pubescent as rachis, rarely glabrous. Flowers: sepals oblong, 1.2–1.8 mm, pubescent, (trichomes simple); petals white or creamy white, spatulate, 1.5–2(–2.5) × 0.7–1 mm; anthers ovate, 0.2–0.3 mm. Fruits ovoid to oblong, plane, slightly inflated, 3.5–6 × 2–3 mm; valves usually glabrous, rarely puberulent, trichomes simple, 0.05–0.15 mm; ovules 14–24 per ovary; style 0.1–0.3 mm. Seeds oblong, 0.9–1.1 × 0.5–0.6 mm. 2n = 16.</description>
