Stems few from base, well-exserted from basal leaves, 0.4–1(–1.2) dm. Basal leaves: blade (erect), obovate to orbicular, 1.5–2.5 cm, (base evidently distinct from petiole), margins entire, (folded). Cauline leaves: blade spatulate, margins entire. Racemes compact, subumbellate. Fruiting pedicels (ascending, curved to slightly sigmoid), 5–8 mm. Flowers: sepals (pale yellow), 4–5 mm; petals lingulate, 6–7 mm. Fruits ovoid to ellipsoid, slightly inflated, (apex not compressed), 3–4 mm; valves pubescent, trichomes erect on mature fruits, (± appearing fuzzy); ovules 8 per ovary; style 4–5 mm, (glabrous). Seeds plump.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><habitat>windswept ridge lines and mountain peaks in limestone rubble and cobbles</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>2600–3000 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Mont.</us_distribution><discussion>Physaria eriocarpa is known from Sheep Mountain.</discussion></treatment>
