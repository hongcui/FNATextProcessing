  <description>Perennials; (densely matted); caudex branched (with persistent leaf remains, some branches terminating in sterile rosettes); scapose. Stems unbranched, 0.04–0.4 dm, usually pubescent throughout, sometimes glabrous basally, trichomes simple, 0.1–1 mm, with 2-rayed ones. Basal leaves (densely imbricate); rosulate; petiolate; petiole base and margin ciliate, (trichomes simple, to 1.4 mm); blade oblanceolate to spatulate or obovate, 0.4–0.8(–1) cm × 2–3.5(–4.5) mm, margins entire, surfaces usually sparsely to densely pilose with simple trichomes, to 1.4 mm, with much fewer, stalked, 2-rayed ones, (sometimes surfaces glabrous, or adaxially only, midvein obscure abaxially). Cauline leaves 0. Racemes (1 or) 2–5(–9)-flowered, ebracteate, not or slightly elongated in fruit; rachis not flexuous, pubescent as stem. Fruiting pedicels divaricate, straight, 1.5–4(–6) mm, pubescent, trichomes simple with fewer, 2-rayed, stalked ones. Flowers: sepals oblong, 2–3 mm, glabrous or sparsely pubescent, (trichomes simple); petals yellowish green to pale yellow, linear-oblanceolate, 3–4 × 0.5–0.8 mm; anthers oblong, 0.4–0.5 mm. Fruits broadly obovoid to subglobose, plane, slightly flattened, 3–5 × 3–4.5 mm; valves glabrous or pubescent, trichomes simple, 0.1–0.3 mm; ovules 4–8 per ovary; style 0.1–0.4 mm. Seeds oblong, (slightly flattened), 1.4–1.8 × 0.9–1.1 mm.</description>
