  <description>Plants sparsely to densely pilose basally, trichomes (soft), simple, to 1.5 mm, these mixed with fewer, forked, stalked ones, sparsely pubescent distally. Stems usually ascending, prostrate, or decumbent, rarely erect, 1.5–7 dm. Basal leaves: petiole 1–3 cm; blade 1.2–7 cm, margins pinnatifid; lobes 3–6 on each side, oblong to linear, 0.3–1.5 cm × 1–3 mm, shorter than terminal, margins entire or dentate. Cauline leaves: (proximal) petiolate or (distal and bracts) sessile; blade similar to basal, smaller and less divided distally. Fruiting pedicels divaricate to ascending, straight or slightly recurved, 5–17(–25) mm, pubescent. Flowers: sepals 2.5–3.5 × 1–1.5 mm, sparsely pubescent; petals spatulate, 3–5 × 1.5–2 mm, not clawed; filaments 2–2.5 mm; anthers ca. 0.5 mm. Fruits oblong, (5–)9–20 × (3–)4–5 mm, length (1.6–)2.8–5 times width; valves (2 or) 4, thin-leathery, smooth, puberulent, trichomes simple, retrorse; septum absent; ovules 25–40 per ovary; style 1–2 mm. Seeds dark brown, 1.2–1.6 × 0.7–1 mm.</description>
