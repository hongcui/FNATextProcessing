    <description>Annuals, biennials, or perennials; eglandular. Trichomes absent or simple. Cauline
        leaves (rarely absent), usually petiolate, sometimes sessile; blade (simple or compound),
        base auriculate or not, margins entire or dentate to pinnately lobed. Racemes usually
        ebracteate (Selenia bracteate throughout), often elongated in fruit. Flowers actinomorphic;
        sepals erect to spreading or ascending, lateral pair seldom saccate basally; petals white,
        yellow, pink, lilac, or purple, claw usually present, rarely absent, often distinct;
        filaments unappendaged, not winged; pollen 3-colpate. Fruits silicles or siliques,
        dehiscent, unsegmented, terete, 4-angled, or latiseptate, rarely angustiseptate; ovules
        4–300[–numerous] per ovary; style distinct or obsolete (absent in Subularia); stigma usually
        entire. Seeds biseriate or uniseriate; cotyledons usually accumbent, sometimes
        incumbent.</description>
