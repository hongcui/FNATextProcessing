Stems several (to several hundred) from base, erect, (each terminating in a tufted cluster of leaves), to 7 dm. Basal leaves: (petiole not differentiated from blade); blade narrowly elliptic to narrowly linear-oblanceolate, (0.8–)1–1.5 cm, (base cuneate), margins entire. Cauline leaves similar to basal, blade sometimes linear, (apex acute). Racemes dense, (often ± subumbellate, somewhat elongated in fruit). Fruiting pedicels (strongly sigmoid), 5–10 mm. Flowers: sepals narrowly elliptic, 2.5–3.5(–4) mm, (not keeled); petals narrowly spatulate, 4–7 mm. Fruits ellipsoid, compressed, 4–6 mm; valves densely pubescent, trichomes appressed; ovules 2 per ovary; style 2–3.5 mm.
