  <description>Annuals, biennials, or perennials; (short-lived, sometimes cespitose); not scapose;
    pubescent throughout, trichomes dendritic, base of plant sometimes mixed with fewer, simple or
    forked, stalked ones. Stems ascending to decumbent, unbranched or branched distally. Leaves
    basal and cauline; petiolate or sessile; basal rosulate, petiolate, blade margins usually
    sinuately lobed to dentate, rarely repand; cauline petiolate or sessile, blade similar to basal.
    Racemes (corymbose, several-flowered), slightly or considerably elongated in fruit. Fruiting
    pedicels divaricate or divaricate-ascending, slender. Flowers: sepals spreading, narrowly
    oblong, (equal), lateral pair not saccate basally; petals white to violet [purple], broadly
    obovate, (much longer than sepals), claw differentiated from blade, (much shorter, apex
    rounded); stamens tetradynamous; filaments not dilated basally, (somewhat spreading); anthers
    linear [narrowly oblong]; nectar glands confluent, subtending bases of stamens. Fruits silicles,
    sessile, broadly oblong [broadly elliptic], smooth, angustiseptate; valves carinate; replum
    rounded; septum complete; ovules 10–50 per ovary; style distinct; stigma broadly capitate,
    entire. Seeds ± biseriate, flattened, not winged, narrowly margined, broadly ovate; seed coat
    (nearly smooth), copiously mucilaginous when wetted; cotyledons accumbent. x = 10.</description>
