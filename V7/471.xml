E. Schulz</variety_authority></TaxonIdentification><description>Perennials; (cespitose, densely pulvinate); caudex branched (branches often tangled with persistent leaf remnants, prostrate, slender, sometimes terminating in sterile rosettes); scapose. Stems unbranched, (0.2–)0.3–0.8 dm, sparsely pubescent proximally, glabrous distally, trichomes usually 2- or 3-rayed, rarely some simple, 0.1–0.25 mm. Basal leaves not rosulate; subsessile; petiole margins not ciliate; blade oblanceolate to oblong or elliptic, 0.3–0.8(–0.9) cm × (1–)1.5–3(–4) mm, margins entire, (not ciliate), surfaces usually pubescent, rarely both surfaces glabrous (except margin), with stalked, 2–4-rayed trichomes, 0.07–0.4 mm (or, rarely, trichomes mostly simple and 2-rayed adaxially). Cauline leaves 0. Racemes (3–)5–11(–14)-flowered, ebracteate, slightly elongated in fruit; rachis not flexuous, glabrous or sparsely pubescent as stem. Fruiting pedicels divaricate-ascending, straight or curved upward, (sometimes slightly expanded basally), 3–8 mm, usually glabrous, rarely sparsely pubescent, trichomes simple and 2- or 3-rayed. Flowers: sepals broadly ovate, 1.7–2.5 mm, glabrous or sparsely pubescent, (trichomes simple and short-stalked, 2- or 3-rayed); petals yellow, spatulate, 2.7–4 × 1.5–2.2 mm; anthers ovate, 0.4–0.5 mm. Fruits broadly lanceolate to ellipsoid or ovoid, plane, inflated at least basally, (2.5–)3.5–7(–8) × (1.5–)2–3.5 mm; valves glabrous or sparsely pubescent, trichomes simple and short-stalked, 2(–4)-rayed, 0.07–0.2 mm; ovules 4–10(–12) per ovary; style 0.3–1(–1.3) mm. Seeds oblong, 1–1.5 × 0.8–1 mm. 2n = 20.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>rock outcrops</habitat><habitat>talus</habitat><habitat>soil pockets on rocky slopes</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>2500–3300 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Nev.</us_distribution><discussion>Draba sphaeroides is closely related to D. pedicellata; the two are easily distinguished using the characteristics discussed by M.
