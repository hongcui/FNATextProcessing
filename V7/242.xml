Stems erect to ascending, branched basally. Leaves not rosulate; alternate (sometimes fasciculate); petiolate, petiole shorter than blade, winged; blade margins usually entire, sometimes toothed near base, teeth 1–2, hyaline. Inflorescences usually dense spikes (or spikelke racemes). Pedicels absent or nearly so. Flowers: sepals persistent, 2–4(–5), distinct, equal; petals 2–3[–5], distinct or basally connate, margins entire or shallowly incised; intrastaminal nectary-discs absent; stamens 3–4[–10]; filaments persistent, distinct or basally connate; ovaries 4(–5)-carpelled. Capsules erect, angled, subglobose to obovoid, walls membranous. Seeds smooth (glossy). x = 15.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 3 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>sw North America</global_distribution><global_distribution>n Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution>sw</global_distribution><global_distribution>c Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution>n</global_distribution><global_distribution>s Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution>n Atlantic Islands.</global_distribution><discussion>Molecular research has shown that Oligomeris is a monophyletic group nested within Reseda in tribe Resedeae and sister to Reseda sect. Glaucoreseda (S. Martín-Bravo et al. 2007). Nonetheless, it seems preferable to maintain the genus; it has clear-cut diagnostic morphological characteristics. Hyaline teeth at the base of the leaves may be vestiges of a laminar segmentation of the leaves (F. Weberling 1968); some have interpreted the teeth as stipular.</discussion></treatment>
