  <discussion>Species 1:</discussion>
  <discussion>Coelophragmus was described as consisting of two species. The type of one, C. umbrosus O. E. Schulz (1924), belongs in Dryopetalon and is conspecific with the type of D. runcinatum A. Gray (1853). Because removal of that species does not constitute effective lectotypification of the genus name, C. auriculatus O. E. Schulz is designated here as type of Coelophragmus.</discussion>
  <discussion>Although Coelophragmus auriculatus was originally described as Sisymbrium auriculatum and recognized as such by every North American botanist, including E. B. Payson (1922) and R. C. Rollins (1993), the species clearly is not a Sisymbrium (S. I. Warwick et al. 2002, 2006b), a genus almost exclusively restricted to the Old World. Coelophragmus is recognized herein as a monotypic genus, and its affinities are nearest Dryopetalon (I. A. Al-Shehbaz et al. 2006). It is unique among all North American genera of the family by having fruit septums deeply partitioned between seeds.</discussion>
