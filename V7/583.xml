  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Perennials; long-lived; sexual; caudex woody. Stems usually 3–5 per caudex branch, arising from margin of rosette, elevated above ground surface on woody base, 1–2.5 dm, densely pubescent proximally, trichomes short-stalked, 2–4 (or 5)-rayed, 0.2–0.4 mm, moderately to sparsely pubescent distally. Basal leaves: blade oblanceolate, 3–5 mm wide, margins entire, ciliate proximally, trichomes (simple), to 0.6 mm, surfaces densely pubescent, trichomes short-stalked, 2–4 (or 5)-rayed, 0.15–0.4 mm. Cauline leaves: 5–9, not concealing stem; blade auricles 0.5–1 mm, surfaces of distalmost leaves sparsely to moderately pubescent. Racemes 5–11-flowered, usually unbranched. Fruiting pedicels descending, straight to slightly recurved, 4–6 mm, pubescent, trichomes appressed, branched. Flowers divaricate-ascending at anthesis; sepals pubescent; petals pale purple, 6–8 × 1.5–2 mm, glabrous; pollen ellipsoid. Fruits (immature) pendent, not appressed to rachis, not secund, straight, edges parallel; valves glabrous. Seeds not seen.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><habitat>metamorphosed igneous gravel on steep slopes</habitat><elevation>ca. 2100 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Idaho.</us_distribution><discussion>Boechera rollinsiorum shows superficial similarities to both B. glareosa and B. lasiocarpa (see M. D. Windham and I. A. Al-Shehbaz 2006 for detailed comparison). It is known thus far only from the type collection below Galena Summit in central Idaho.</discussion></treatment>
