  <description>Plants scapose; moderately to densely pubescent, trichomes 2-forked and simple. Stems simple or few to several from base, erect, 0.2–0.7(–10) dm. Basal leaves: blade narrowly spatulate to oblanceolate, (0.5–)1–3(–4) cm × 1–3 mm, base (membranous), broadly expanded near point of attachment, margins entire, (sparsely ciliate proximally), apex obtuse. Cauline leaves: 0 or 1 (or a leaflike bract subtending proximalmost pedicel). Fruiting pedicels erect or ascending, 1–2.6 mm. Flowers: sepals 2–2.6 × 1–1.5 mm; petals white or rose-purple, 2.4–3.8(–4) × (0.8–)1–1.3(–2) mm, (claw and blade often gradually and not well-differentiated, apex rounded); filaments 1.7–2 mm; anthers oblong, 0.3–0.4 mm. Fruits lanceoloid-subulate, not torulose, (straight), (0.3–)0.4–0.7 cm × (0.7–)1–1.5(–1.7) mm; valves densely to moderately pubescent, trichomes 2-forked and simple; septum margin broadly expanded basally (forming sacklike pouch around proximalmost seed in each locule); ovules 10–16 per ovary; style (0.5–)0.6–1(–1.2) mm; stigma 2-lobed or entire. Seeds uniseriate, oblong, (0.9–)1–1.3 × (0.4–)0.5–0.6(–0.7) mm. 2n = 56.</description>

  <discussion>Braya fernaldii and B. longii are closely related northwestern Newfoundland endemics that differ from the remaining species of Braya by their lanceoloid-subulate fruits and septum margins that broadly expand basally to produce a sacklike pouch around bases of proximalmost seeds in each locule.</discussion>
