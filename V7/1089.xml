Stems simple from base, erect to decumbent, (unbranched, mostly filiform, slender), 1–1.5 dm. Basal leaves (erect, petiole slender); blades broadly ovate to elliptic, 0.5–1 cm, (base abruptly narrowing to petiole), margins entire. Cauline leaves (remote, distally shortly petiolate); blade ± spatulate, (base cuneate), margins entire. Racemes lax, (elongated, few-flowered). Fruiting pedicels (recurved to widely spreading, filiform, slender), 5–10 mm. Flowers: sepals (erect), oblong, 3.5–4 mm, (lateral pair not saccate); petals (often fading to light purple apically), spatulate to nearly lingulate, 6–7 mm. Fruits (pendent), globose or subglobose, compressed, 3–4 mm; valves ± densely pubescent; ovules 6–10 per ovary; style ca. 1.5 mm.
