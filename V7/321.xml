  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Annuals; canescent throughout, trichomes appressed, coarse, 8–16-rayed, rays often subequal. Stems often several from base, erect, ascending, or decumbent, (unbranched or few-branched distally), (0.2–)0.4–1.6(–2) dm. Cauline leaves subsessile; blade oblanceolate or linear-oblanceolate, (0.5–)0.7–1.5(–2) cm × (1–)2–4(–6) mm (gradually smaller distally), base attenuate, apex subacute. Fruiting pedicels ascending to suberect, straight, stout, 1–3(–4) mm, trichomes uniformly stellate. Flowers: sepals oblong, 1.2–1.5 × 0.5–0.6 mm, stellate-pubescent (trichomes with longer rays and appearing simple near apex); petals pale yellow, spatulate, 1.7–2 × 0.4–0.5 mm, base abruptly narrowed to claw, apex deeply emarginate, glabrous; filaments: median pairs not toothed, slightly expanded basally, lateral pair with basal appendage to 0.5 × 0.1 mm, often apically 2-toothed, 1.4–1.7 mm; anthers ovate, 0.1–0.2 mm. Fruits ovate-oblong, (3–)3.5–5 × (2.5–)3–4 mm, apex obtuse; valves uniformly inflated at middle, broadly flattened at margins, densely stellate-pubescent (rays equal); ovules 2 per ovary; style (slender), 0.3–0.5 mm, basally stellate-pubescent. Seeds ovoid, compressed, 1.6–1.9 × 1.2–1.6 mm, margins winglike, 0.1–0.3 mm wide. 2n = 16.</description><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><habitat>rocky soil</habitat><elevation>1500–2000 m;</elevation><introduced>introduced;</introduced><us_distribution>Utah</us_distribution><global_distribution>sw Asia.</global_distribution><discussion>Alyssum szowitsianum is known in the flora area only from Salt Lake County.</discussion></treatment>
