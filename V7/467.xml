  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Perennials; (matted); caudex branched (with persistent leaf remains, branches slender, prostrate, sometimes terminating in sterile rosettes); not scapose. Stems usually unbranched, (0.5–)1–2.4(–3) dm, pubescent throughout, trichomes short-stalked, subdendritic, 4–12-rayed, 0.05–0.2 mm. Basal leaves rosulate; petiole (obscure), usually not ciliate, rarely pubescent proximally, (trichomes simple or spurred, to 0.25 mm); blade obovate to narrowly oblanceolate, 0.5–1.3(–2.5) cm × (1–)2–4(–7) mm, margins usually entire, rarely denticulate, surfaces pubescent with short-stalked, subdendritic, 5–12-rayed trichomes, 0.05–0.3 mm. Cauline leaves (2 or) 3–8; sessile; blade oblong to lanceolate, margins usually entire, rarely denticulate, surfaces pubescent as basal, or, rarely, adaxially with long-stalked, 2–5-rayed trichomes. Racemes 12–28-flowered, ebracteate, elongated in fruit; rachis not flexuous, pubescent as stem. Fruiting pedicels divaricate, straight, (3–)5–10(–13) mm, pubescent as stem. Flowers: sepals ovate, 2–2.5 mm, pubescent; petals white, spatulate, 4–6 × 2–3 mm; anthers ovate, 0.5–0.6 mm. Fruits ovate-lanceolate, twisted, flattened, 5–9 × 2–3 mm; valves pubescent, trichomes simple and short-stalked, 2–4-rayed, 0.05–0.2 mm; ovules 16–20 per ovary; style (0.7–)1–2(–2.3) mm. Seeds oblong, 0.8–1.2 × 0.5–0.7 mm. 2n = 32.</description><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><habitat>igneous outcrops and rocky slopes in mixed conifer, mountain shrub, and (rarely) sagebrush communities</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>2300–3700 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Colo.</us_distribution><discussion>Draba smithii is a distinctive species known only from Archuleta, Las Animas, and Mineral counties in southern Colorado.</discussion></treatment>
