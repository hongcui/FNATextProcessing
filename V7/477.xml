  <description>Perennials; (tufted); caudex simple or branched (covered with persistent leaf remains); not scapose. Stems usually unbranched, (0.2–)0.4–2.5 dm, hirsute proximally, sparsely pubescent or glabrous distally or throughout, trichomes simple, 0.4–2.2 mm, often with stalked, 2(–4)-rayed ones, 0.2–1 mm. Basal leaves rosulate; blade oblong-oblanceolate to linear-oblanceolate, 0.5–3.8 cm × 1.5–6 mm, margins entire, (ciliate, trichomes setiform, simple, 0.6–2.8 mm), surfaces strigose to hirsute abaxially with long-stalked, 2(–4)-rayed trichomes, 0.4–1.4 mm, usually with simple ones, strigose adaxially with simple trichomes, 0.7–2.4 mm. Cauline leaves 2–15; sessile; blade oblong to lanceolate, margins entire, surfaces pubescent as basal. Racemes 9–62-flowered, ebracteate or proximalmost 1–3 flowers bracteate, elongated in fruit; rachis not flexuous, sparsely pubescent as stem or glabrous. Fruiting pedicels ascending, slightly curved or straight, 4–12 mm, glabrous or pubescent abaxially, trichomes simple (0.4–1.6 mm). Flowers: sepals oblong, 2.5–3.5 mm, usually pubescent, rarely glabrous, (trichomes simple, sometimes with stalked, 2-rayed ones); petals yellow, oblanceolate to spatulate, (4–)5–7.5 × 1–2(–2.5) mm; anthers ovate, 0.5–0.7 mm. Fruits ovate to linear-lanceolate, usually strongly twisted (to 3 turns), rarely plane, flattened, 5–16 × 2–3 mm; valves puberulent along margin, trichomes simple, 0.05–0.3 mm; ovules 20–34 per ovary; style (0.8–) 1–2(–2.5) mm. Seeds ovoid, 0.9–1.2 × 0.6–0.7 mm. 2n = 20, 40.</description>

  <discussion>Draba streptocarpa is easily recognized by its strongly twisted fruits and broad-based, simple cilia on the basal leaves. It is found primarily in Colorado, but has also been collected in Larimer County, Wyoming, and Mora, San Miguel, and Taos counties, New Mexico.</discussion>
