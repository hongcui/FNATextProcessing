  <discussion>Draba inexpectata is known from the Uinta Mountains in Summit County. The measurements above are based on the holotype (Franklin 6328) and two of the three paratypes (Franklin 6293, 6331), all at BRY. One paratype (Goodrich 26166, BRY) is a robust, completely sterile plant of uncertain identity and was not used for the description above.</discussion>
  <discussion>Although compared in the original description with Draba lonchocarpa (with which it grows sympatrically), D. inexpectata appears most closely related to D. cana. Draba inexpectata is distinguished from the latter by having stems 1–4 cm, basal leaves non-ciliate, racemes that are 2–5(–8)-flowered and scarcely elongated in fruit, fruits elliptic to lanceolate, 3.5–5 mm, and ovules 16–24 per ovary. By contrast, D. cana has stems (6–)10–30 cm, basal leaves ciliate at the apex, racemes that are (10–)15–47(–63)-flowered and often considerably elongated in fruit, fruits linear-lanceolate or very rarely ovate-oblong, (5–)6–11 mm, and ovules 28–48 per ovary.</discussion>
