  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Perennials; (densely cespitose); caudex branched (densely covered with persistent leaves, branches sometimes terminating in sterile rosettes); scapose. Stems unbranched, (0.05–)0.15–0.5(–0.6) dm, hirsute through-out, trichomes simple, 0.1–0.8 mm, and 2–4-rayed, 0.0.5–0.4 mm. Basal leaves (densely imbricate); rosulate; sessile; blade oblanceolate to ovate, 0.4–1.5 cm × 1.5–3.5 mm, margins entire, (ciliate, trichomes simple, 0.3–1.1 mm), surfaces pubescent abaxially with stalked, (2–)4–6-rayed trichomes, 0.1–5 mm, (midvein obscure), adaxially glabrous proximally, sparsely pubescent distally with mostly simple trichomes. Cauline leaves 0. Racemes 3–12(–18)-flowered, ebracteate, slightly elongated in fruit; rachis not flexuous, hirsute as stem. Fruiting pedicels ascending, straight, 2–6(–8) mm, hirsute as stem. Flowers: sepals oblong, 2.5–3 mm, hirsute, (trichomes simple and stalked, 2–4-rayed); petals white, spatulate, 4.5–6 × 1.5–2 mm; anthers oblong, 0.8–1 mm. Fruits ovate to elliptic, plane, slightly flattened, 4–8(–11) × 2.5–4.5 mm; valves pubescent, trichomes stalked (2–)4-rayed, 0.05–0.5 mm; ovules 8–16 per ovary; style (1.2–)2–4(–4.5) mm. Seeds oblong, 1.4–2 × 0.9–1 mm. 2n = 54.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>limestone outcrops and gravelly soil</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>2900–3600 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Nev.</us_distribution><discussion>Draba jaegeri is superficially similar to D. hitchcockii, a narrow endemic of the Lost River Range in central Idaho. Both species are cespitose perennials with relatively large, white flowers, and a chromosome number (2n = 54) otherwise unknown in Draba (M. D. Windham 2004). Draba jaegeri is readily distinguished from D. hitchcockii by having fruits pubescent with (2–)4-rayed trichomes, styles (1.2–)2–4(–4.5) mm, fruiting pedicels 2–6(–8) mm, and spatulate petals 1.5–2 mm wide. By contrast, D. hitchcockii has fruits pubescent with mostly simple and 2-rayed trichomes (with 3- or 4-rayed ones), styles (0.8–)1–1.7(–2) mm, fruiting pedicels (2–)4–13(–18) mm, and obovate petals 2–3.5 mm wide. Draba jaegeri is known only from the Charleston Mountains in Clark County.</discussion></treatment>
