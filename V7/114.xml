  <discussion>Salix arizonica is very similar to S. boothii. They were separated by Dorn on the presence of five flavonoid compounds identified in S. boothii not found in S. arizonica. Some morphological differences were noted but the characters used to separate them are quite variable. The most important feature seems to be the usually broader leaves of S. arizonica. In addition, the diploid chromosome number for S. arizonica separates it from the tetraploid S. boothii. Although the two are distinct species, the overlap in their morphological characters suggests that positive identification needs to be based on chromosome number or chromatographic analysis.</discussion>
  <discussion>Salix arizonica is distinguished from S. boothii by having stipule apices convex to rounded, petioles 3–7.5 mm, juvenile blades glabrous or hairy, hairs white, largest medial blades elliptic or broadly elliptic, 20–50 mm, 1.6–3.6 times as long as wide, abaxial surfaces with white hairs, staminate catkins 1–1.7 times as long as broad, pistillate catkins 1.2–2.8 times as long broad, floral bract apices acute to convex, nectaries narrowly oblong to oblong, staminate nectaries 0.4–0.8 mm, anthers 0.4–0.6 mm, filaments distinct, glabrous, pistillate nectaries shorter to longer than stipes, stipes 0.2–1 mm, stigmas broadly cylindrical, and capsules 3.2–4.5 mm; S. boothii has stipule apices acuminate or acute to rounded, petioles 3–17 mm, juvenile blades hairy, hairs white, sometimes also ferruginous, largest medial blades lorate to narrowly or broadly elliptic, 26–102 mm, 2–5.2 times as long as wide, abaxial surfaces with white, sometimes also ferruginous, hairs, staminate catkins 1.2–3.1 times as long as broad, pistillate catkins 1.4–4.1 times as long as broad, floral bract apices rounded or retuse, nectaries narrowly oblong to ovate or flask-shaped, staminate nectaries 0.6–1.5 mm, anthers 0.48–0.8 mm, filaments distinct to connate about half their lengths, glabrous or hairy, pistillate nectaries shorter than stipes, stipes 0.5–2.5 mm, stigmas flat, abaxially non-papillate with rounded tip, slenderly cylindrical or plump, and capsules 2.5–6 mm.</discussion>
  <discussion>Salix arizonica, originally known from Mt. Baldy in east-central Arizona, was proposed for listing under the United States Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants Act, but the proposal was withdrawn when additional populations were discovered in southern Utah and in New Mexico; it is now listed as a “sensitive species” (K. Decker, www.fs.us/r2/projects/scp/assessments/salixarizonica.pdf). Major conservation concerns are from browsing by cattle and elk (J. Maschinski 2001) and Melampsora infection (M. L. Fairweather 1993; R. A. Obedzinski et al. 2001). The Arizona populations receive minimal protection from cattle and wildlife browsing by exclosures and by introduction into new localities. The Arizona and Utah populations have a genetic similarity of ca. 37%, which has been attributed to a period of panmixis followed by a long period of isolation in regions with different environments (J. T. Thompson et al. 2003).</discussion>
