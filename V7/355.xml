  <description>Perennials; (caudex simple or branched, covered with persistent petiolar remains); sparsely to moderately pubescent, trichomes simple, forked-stalked, or rarely cruciform or 3-rayed, stalked, stellate. Stems simple or few from base (caudex), erect, unbranched or branched (few) distally, 0.6–2.5(–3) dm, (usually pubescent throughout, rarely subglabrate). Basal leaves: petiole 0.5–3(–6) cm, (ciliate); blade oblanceolate, spatulate, or obovate, (1.5–)2.1–3.5(–6) cm × (5–)8–20(–25) mm, margins entire or dentate, (ciliate), apex obtuse, surfaces pubescent or glabrous, trichomes simple and forked, sometimes mixed with 3- or 4-rayed stellate ones. Cauline leaves (2 or) 3–6 (or 7); blade oblong or ovate, 1–2(–4) cm × (2–)4–10(–15) mm, base not auriculate, margins entire or dentate, (ciliate), apex obtuse, surfaces pubescent as basal leaves. Racemes simple, (dense). Fruiting pedicels ascending to erect, (3–)5–10(–15) mm. Flowers: sepals (purple), oblong, 5–7 × 1.5–2 mm, lateral pair saccate basally; petals purple, spatulate or broadly so, (12–)14–18 × 4–7 mm, apex obtuse or rounded; filaments 6–8 mm; anthers narrowly oblong, 1.2–1.5 mm. Fruits erect or nearly so, slightly torulose, 2–4 cm × 2–3 mm; valves each with prominent midvein extending full length or rarely to middle; ovules 20–28 per ovary; style 0.2–1(–1.5) mm. Seeds narrowly winged throughout, orbicular or suborbicular, 2–2.5 mm in diam.; wing 0.2–0.4 mm wide (wider distally). 2n = 16.</description>
