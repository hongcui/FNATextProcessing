  <discussion>Salix setchelliana shares some unique characters with members of subg. Longifoliae and some Populus. It produces shoots from roots, the catkins are sometimes branched, and the leaves are isolateral, with hypodermis present on both sides of the blade (W. Buechler, pers. comm.). While it is possible that these characters evolved independently, it is more likely that they were derived from a common ancestor.</discussion>
  <discussion>Salix setchelliana is a highly successful colonizer of temporary gravel bar habitats. This is made possible by rapid expansion of its clones by root shoots and its ability to become established in new locations by both seedlings and clonal fragments (D. A. Douglas 1989).</discussion>
