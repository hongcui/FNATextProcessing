  <discussion>G. A. Mulligan (1971b) first reported apomixis in Draba ventosa based on studies of Canadian populations. This has now been confirmed in one of the southernmost populations (Duchesne County, Utah; M. D. Windham, unpubl.) as well. The species is easily overlooked and the large geographic gap between the Canadian and United States populations is likely to be narrowed or eliminated by additional collecting in western Montana. The limits of this species were expanded by C. L. Hitchcock (1941) to include D. ruaxes, but there are clear differences between them that support their recognition as distinct species.</discussion>
