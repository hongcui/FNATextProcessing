  <description>Annuals, biennials, or perennials; eglandular. Trichomes stalked or sessile,
        stellate, dendritic, or forked, sometimes mixed with simple ones. Cauline leaves usually
        sessile, rarely petiolate or subsessile; blade base auriculate or not, margins usually
        entire, sometimes dentate or, rarely, lyrate. Racemes ebracteate [bracteate], often
        elongated in fruit. Flowers actinomorphic; sepals erect, spreading, or ascending, lateral
        pair usually not saccate basally; petals [absent] white, yellow, pink, lavender, or purple
        [orange], claw present, often distinct; filaments unappendaged, not winged; pollen
        3-colpate. Fruits silicles or siliques, dehiscent or indehiscent, unsegmented, terete,
        latiseptate, or angustiseptate; ovules 2–200[–numerous] per ovary; style often distinct;
        stigma usually entire [2-lobed (subentire in Turritis)]. Seeds biseriate or uniseriate
        [aseriate]; cotyledons accumbent or incumbent.</description>

  <discussion>Camelineae appeared as a monophyletic lineage in M. A. Beilstein et al. (2006); the
        sampling included seven genera and, with study of further genera, the boundaries of tribe
        may well need to be redefined.</discussion>
