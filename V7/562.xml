Stems usually 1 per caudex branch, arising from center of rosette near ground surface, 1–2.5 dm, glabrous or sparsely pubescent proximally, trichomes short-stalked, 2–5-rayed (rarely, some simple), 0.4–0.6 mm, glabrous distally. Basal leaves: blade oblanceolate, 2.5–6 mm wide, margins entire, ciliate proximally, trichomes (simple), surfaces densely pubescent, trichomes short-stalked, 4–7-rayed, 0.3–0.5 mm. Cauline leaves: 3–12, often concealing stem proximally; blade auricles 0.5–2 mm, surfaces of distalmost leaves usually glabrous, sometimes margins ciliate. Racemes 12–25-flowered, usually unbranched. Fruiting pedicels ascending to divaricate-descending, straight, 2–6 mm, glabrous. Flowers ascending at anthesis; sepals pubescent; petals purple, 5–6 × 1.5–2 mm, glabrous; pollen spheroid. Fruits ascending to divaricate-ascending, not appressed to rachis, not secund, straight, edges parallel, 2–3.7 cm × 2–2.8 mm; valves glabrous; ovules 56–80 per ovary; style 0.1–0.3 mm. Seeds uniseriate, 1–1.5 × 0.8–1 mm; wing distal or continuous, 0.05–0.1 mm wide.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><habitat>granitic ledges and talus slopes</habitat><elevation>2700–3400 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><discussion>Boechera peirsonii is an apomictic species of unknown origin; although previously treated as a variety of Arabis (B.) breweri, it is quite distinct from that taxon (see M. D. Windham and I. A. Al-Shehbaz 2007 for detailed comparison). All known collections come from the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California, ca. 200 km distant from the nearest populations of B. breweri.</discussion></treatment>
