    <description>Biennials; short-lived; sexual; caudex not evident. Stems usually 1 per plant,
        arising from center of rosette near ground surface, 4–10 dm, glabrous throughout. Basal
        leaves: blade obovate to oblanceolate, 5–20 mm wide, margins dentate, not ciliate, surfaces
        glabrous or subapically puberulent, trichomes simple, 0.1–0.2 mm. Cauline leaves: 30–80, not
        concealing stem; blade auricles absent, surfaces of distalmost leaves glabrous. Racemes
        70–150-flowered, multi-branched. Fruiting pedicels divaricate-ascending to horizontal,
        straight or gently recurved, 6–15 mm, glabrous. Flowers divaricate-ascending at anthesis;
        sepals glabrous; petals white, 2.8–4 × 0.6–1 mm, glabrous; pollen ellipsoid. Fruits
        divaricate-ascending to widely pendent, not appressed to rachis, not secund, straight or
        slightly curved, edges parallel, 4.3–7.9 cm × 1.5–1.8 mm; valves glabrous; ovules 30–42 per
        ovary; style 0.1–0.2 mm. Seeds uniseriate, 1.2–1.7 × 0.7–1 mm; wing continuous or,
        sometimes, distal (rarely absent), 0.1–0.2 mm wide. 2n = 14. Flowering Jul–Sep. Shale
        barrens and wooded slopes of crumbling shale; of conservation concern; 100–500 m; Va.,
        W.Va.</description>
    <discussion>boechera serotina is unique among members of the genus in its highly branched
        inflorescences and late (summer–fall) anthesis. it is in the center for plant conservation’s
        national collection of endangered plants</discussion>
