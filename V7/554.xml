Stems usually 2–4 per caudex branch, arising from center of rosette near ground surface, or arising laterally proximal to sterile shoots, 0.6–2 dm, glabrous throughout. Basal leaves: blade oblanceolate, 2–6 mm wide, margins entire, rarely ciliate along petiole, trichomes (simple), 0.5–0.7 mm, surfaces glabrous. Cauline leaves: 5–9, rarely concealing stem proximally; blade auricles 0.7–2.5 mm, surfaces of distalmost leaves glabrous. Racemes 4–12-flowered, usually unbranched. Fruiting pedicels divaricate-ascending to horizontal, straight, 2.5–8 mm, glabrous. Flowers ascending at anthesis; sepals glabrous; petals lavender, 4–5.5 × 1.5–2 mm, glabrous; pollen ellipsoid. Fruits usually divaricate-ascending, rarely slightly descending, usually secund, straight to slightly curved, 1.9–4 cm × 2–3 mm; valves glabrous; ovules 52–72 per ovary; style 0.05–0.2 mm. Seeds biseriate, 1.1–1.4 × 0.8–1 mm; wing continuous, 0.07–0.15 mm wide.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><habitat>ledges and talus of limestone cliffs</habitat><elevation>3000–3400 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Nev.</us_distribution><discussion>Boechera nevadensis usually is treated as a synonym of Arabis pendulina (R. C. Rollins 1993) or B. demissa (N. H. Holmgren 2005b), but is amply distinct from both (see M. D. Windham and I. A. Al-Shehbaz 2006 for detailed comparison). It is known only from Clark and Nye counties.</discussion></treatment>
