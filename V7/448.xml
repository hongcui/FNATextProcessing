E. Schulz</variety_authority></TaxonIdentification><description>Perennials; (cespitose, long-lived); caudex simple or branched (covered with persis-tent petioles), not scapose. Stems usually unbranched, rarely branched, 0.3–1.9(–2.8) dm, moderately to densely hirsute throughout, trichomes simple, 0.2–1.3 mm, with short-stalked to subsessile, cruciform, 0.02–0.4 mm, and 2-rayed ones, 0.3–0.9 mm. Basal leaves rosulate; petiolate; petiole ciliate, (trichomes simple, 0.4–1.5 mm); blade oblanceolate, 1–5(–6) cm × 2–5(–10) mm, margins usually entire, rarely denticulate, surfaces pubescent, abaxially with stalked, cruciform trichomes, 0.07–0.5 mm, adaxially often similar, sometimes with fewer, simple and 2-rayed trichomes, 0.4–1.3 mm. Cauline leaves 3–10; sessile; blade ovate to lanceolate or oblong, margins entire or denticulate, surfaces pubescent as basal. Racemes 10–37(–58)-flowered, ebracteate, elongated in fruit; rachis not flexuous, pubescent as stem. Fruiting pedicels divaricate-ascending, straight, 4–10 mm, pubescent throughout, trichomes simple (0.1–0.5 mm) and subsessile, 2–4-rayed, (0.03–0.2 mm). Flowers: sepals oblong, 2–3.5 mm, pubescent, (trichomes simple and 2-rayed); petals yellow, oblanceolate, 3.5–6 × 1.2–1.8 mm; anthers oblong, 0.8–1 mm. Fruits lanceolate to elliptic, often strongly twisted, flattened, 5–11 × 2–3 mm; valves puberulent at least along margin, trichomes simple, antrorse, 0.03–0.15 mm; ovules 14–24 per ovary; style 0.8–1.8(–2.5) mm. Seeds ovoid, 1–1.4 × 0.6–0.9 mm.</description><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><habitat>crevices</habitat><habitat>ledges of cliffs</habitat><elevation>1200–2800 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><discussion>Draba petrophila is often broadly circumscribed to include the taxon herein called D. viridis. For a discussion of the differences between these species and the closely related D. helleriana, see I. A. Al-Shehbaz and M. D. Windham (2007). Draba petrophila, in the strict sense, is known only from Cochise, Pima, and Santa Cruz counties in southeastern Arizona.</discussion></treatment>
