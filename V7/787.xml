  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Perennials; (terrestrial or of wet habitat, not submerged, with underground rhizomes); gla-brous or pilose, (trichomes crisped). Stems decumbent, much-branched distally, 0.5–2.5(–3) dm, (glabrous or pilose proximally). Basal leaves not rosulate; blade margins subpinnatifid to sinuate. Cauline leaves sessile or shortly petiolate; blade broadly oblanceolate to oblong, (lateral lobes oblong to ovate), 1–3.2 cm × 3–12 mm, base not or minutely auriculate, margins subpinnatifid to sinuate, or (lateral lobes) usually entire, (surfaces pilose or adaxially glabrous). Racemes (subumbellate), not or slightly elongated. Fruiting pedicels erect to divaricate-ascending, straight, 3–7(–9) mm, (pilose). Flowers: sepals (persistent), erect, oblong or ovate, 2–3 × 1–1.5 mm; petals yellow, spatulate to oblanceolate, 2.5–3.5 × 1–1.7 mm; median filaments 2–2.5 mm; anthers narrowly oblong, 0.8–1.2 mm. Fruits silicles, straight, subglobose to broadly oblong, 3–6 × 2–3.5 mm; valves glabrous; ovules 30–44 per ovary; style 0.8–1.5 mm. Seeds biseriate, yellowish brown, angled, cordiform, 0.8–1.1 mm, strongly colliculate.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><habitat>shores of lakes</habitat><habitat>beaches</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>1800–2000 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Nev.</us_distribution><discussion>Rorippa subumbellata appears to be restricted to Tallac and Truckee lakes and Lake Tahoe in eastern California (El Dorado and Placer counties) and western Nevada (Douglas County).</discussion><discussion>The record by Rollins of n = 5 for the species (see S. I. Warwick and I. A. Al-Shehbaz 2006) is highly unlikely; no such count is known in the entire tribe Cardamineae, to which Rorippa belongs.</discussion><discussion>Rorippa subumbellata is in the Center for Plant Conservation’s National Collection of Endangered Plants.</discussion></treatment>
