  <description>Herbs, shrubs, or subshrubs, annual or perennial. Stems sparsely branched laterally; puberulent, glabrous, or glabrate (scabrid when dry). Leaves: stipules minute tufts of filiform hairs; petiole without pulvinus (equal to or longer than leaflets); leaflets (1 or) 3, (conduplicate). Inflorescences terminal, racemes (dense); bracts usually absent; (pedicels 3–5 mm, glabrous). Flowers: zygomorphic; sepals usually persistent (eventually deciduous), distinct, equal; petals slightly unequal (in pairs); stamens 6 (well-exserted, ± equal); filaments inserted on gynophore, glabrous; anthers (oblong), coiling after dehiscence; gynophore reflexed in fruit; (pistil 2-lobed basally, style filiform, eventually spinelike). Fruits schizocarps, indehiscent, obovate, (reticulate, ± tuberculate, valves disarticulating from persistent, round septum). Seeds 2(–4), globose, not arillate. x = 10.</description>

  <discussion>Wislizenia has been the object of diverse taxonomic opinions; as many as eight or as few as one species have been recognized. S. Keller (1979) documented three geographically and morphologically distinct groups within the genus. Although she treated those as subspecies, recognition as species seems more appropriate (H. H. Iltis, pers. comm.). The differentiation among the taxa seems equal to or greater than that among species in other genera of the family.</discussion>
