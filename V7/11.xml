  <discussion>Populus fremontii hybridizes with P. deltoides subsp. wislizeni where they come in contact in the Colorado Plateau region and trans-Pecos Texas. Hybrids have longer pedicels and narrower discs than does P. fremontii, and less densely hairy twigs in regions where P. fremontii is densely pubescent. It also hybridizes with the two members of sect. Tacamahaca with which it overlaps, P. trichocarpa (P. ×parryi Sargent), and P. angustifolia (P. ×hinckleyana Correll) (synonyms P. ×acuminata Rydberg nothomorph rehderi Sargent and P. ×intercurrens S. Goodrich &amp; S. L. Welsh). Both hybrids have smaller, more numerous teeth on preformed leaves than does P. fremontii, with blades clearly paler abaxially than adaxially, and buds with reddish resin (J. E. Eckenwalder 1984). Preformed leaves are broadly ovate to heart-shaped in P. ×parryi (Eckenwalder 1984b) and usually ovate in P. ×hinckleyana; trees from the type locality in the Davis Mountains, Texas, had round leaves (D. S. Correll 1960). They could be distinguished from P. ×parryi by their smaller leaf blades and hairy petioles. Trees of P. ×parryi have been found in Mohave County, Arizona, east of the present range of P. trichocarpa (Eckenwalder 1992).</discussion>
  <discussion>Populus ×inopina Eckenwalder is a hybrid between P. fremontii and P. nigra known only from the type locality along Coyote Creek, San Jose, California, where P. nigra was the seed parent (J. E. Eckenwalder 1982). Trees of the same parentage were produced artificially by A. B. Stout and E. J. Schreiner (1933); none appears to have survived. They differ from P. nigra in broader habit, twigs thicker, buds thicker and less red, broader and more cordate leaves with larger teeth, and more numerous stamens. They differ from P. fremontii in narrower habit, twigs more orange, buds without a green cast, longer leaf apices, more numerous teeth, and fewer stamens. If pistillate trees occur, they would be expected to have 2 or 3 carpels and discs 3–5 mm diam., both intermediate between those of the parents.</discussion>
