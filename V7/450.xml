  <discussion>O. E. Schulz (1927) reduced Draba pilosa to a variety of the decaploid D. alpina and cited North American collections. The former species was not listed by C. L. Hitchcock (1941) or R. C. Rollins (1993). From D. alpina, D. pilosa is easily distinguished by having strongly thickened and persistent (versus not thickened) midveins and margins, and usually narrower leaf blades [1–2.5(–5) versus 2.5–6(–9) mm wide].</discussion>
  <discussion>As recognized herein, Draba pilosa is broadly circumscribed to include perhaps two or three closely related taxa. All are scapose plants with large, yellow flowers and prominent, persistent midveins and petioles. Some Alaskan forms (e.g., Parker 7596, ALA), which grow in moist heath habitats, have leaves 3–5 mm wide, whereas the majority have narrower leaf blades rarely reaching 2.5 mm in width. Most plants assigned to this species have leaves with exclusively simple trichomes and often glabrous scapes. Others (e.g., Chesemore &amp; Davies 13, Murray 3371, Parker &amp; Batten 8954, all at ALA) have leaf blade surfaces and scapes with 2–4-rayed trichomes and blade margins ciliate with simple trichomes. One collection (Walker s.n., ALA) has a mixture of plants of both trichome types but no intermediates were found. Detailed molecular and cytological studies are needed on this complex to determine if more than one taxon is represented.</discussion>
