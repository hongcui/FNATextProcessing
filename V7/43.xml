  <discussion>Salix triandra usually has been overlooked in North American floras. At one time, it was a very important basket willow and probably was introduced into North America for that purpose. Some authors treat the glaucous and nonglaucous forms as subspecies (F. Martini and P. Paiero 1988; K. H. Rechinger 1993); A. K. Skvortsov (1999) noted that, although the two have somewhat distinct ranges, both kinds occur throughout the species and sometimes can be found in the same population. His suggestion that genetic inheritance of this character should be studied has not been taken up. The species is characterized by bark that is dark gray, smooth, and flaking in large irregular patches, as in Platanus ×acerifolia. The ovary-style transition is so indistinct that styles are often described as absent, but there are two, distinct styles, each terminating in a short stigma. A color change, later in the season, between the styles and ovary suggests that the tip of the ovary and the two distinct styles are both stylar tissues. In general, it appears that the styles are connate proximally and distinct distally.</discussion>
  <discussion>Collections of Salix triandra made in 1934–35 by H. Hyland along the Penobscot River, Orono, Maine, were labeled by him as “introduced,” but they could have spread from cultivation or have been naturalized (A. Haines, pers. comm.). Recent naturalized occurrences are known from Toronto, Ontario, and Wolfville, Nova Scotia. Specimens identified as S. triandra by C. R. Ball are from Virginia and the District of Columbia. Salix triandra is reported to occur in Ohio (T. D. Sydnor and W. F. Cowen 2000) but voucher specimens were not found.</discussion>
