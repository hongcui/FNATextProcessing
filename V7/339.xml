Cauline leaves 4–8; blade oblong or ovate, 1–5 cm × 5–20 mm, base subcordate or auriculate, margins usually dentate, rarely subentire, apex acute or obtuse. Racemes simple, (lax). Fruiting pedicels ascending to divaricate, 7–17(–20) mm. Flowers: sepals oblong, 4.5–8 × 1–2 mm, lateral pair conspicuously saccate basally; petals white, spatulate to obovate, 10–19 × 4–8 mm, apex obtuse; filaments 4–7 mm; anthers oblong, 0.7–1.2 mm. Fruits ascending to spreading, torulose, (3–)4–7 cm × 1–2 mm; valves each with midvein absent or obscure, along proximal 1/2; ovules 40–60 per ovary; style 0.5–1 mm.
