Stems 1–4 per caudex branch, arising from margin of rosette near ground surface, 1–3 dm, glabrous throughout. Basal leaves: blade linear-oblanceolate to oblanceolate, 1–3(–5) mm wide, margins entire or minutely toothed, rarely ciliate near petiole base, trichomes (simple), to 0.8 mm, surfaces pubescent or glabrous, trichomes short-stalked, 3–6-rayed, 0.07–0.2 mm. Cauline leaves: 4–15, not concealing stem; blade auricles 0.5–2.5 mm, surfaces of distalmost leaves glabrous. Racemes 12–40-flowered, usually unbranched. Fruiting pedicels reflexed, abruptly recurved near base, 4–8 mm, glabrous. Flowers divaricate to pendent at anthesis; sepals pubescent; petals lavender, 5–6 × ca. 1 mm, glabrous; pollen ellipsoid or spheroid. Fruits reflexed to closely pendent, usually appressed to rachis, often secund, straight, edges parallel, 0.3–0.42 cm × 1–1.5 mm; valves glabrous; ovules 46–60 per ovary. Seeds uniseriate, 1–1.3 × 0.8–1 mm; wing continuous, 0.05–0.1 mm wide.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><habitat>igneous rock outcrops</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>1900–2100 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Oreg.</us_distribution><discussion>Both sexual and apomictic collections of Boechera hastatula have been identified; further study is needed to determine whether they truly are conspecific.
