    <description>Plants with woody base, sparsely to densely pubescent. Stems few to numerous from
        base, (0.2–)0.5–1.6(–2) dm, usually sparsely to densely pubescent proximally, sometimes
        glaucous and glabrous distally. Cauline leaves often persistent in subsequent seasons as
        pectinate spines; petiolate proximally, subsessile distally; petiole winged, 0–3(–5) mm;
        blade linear (in outline), (0.5–)1–2.2(–2.8) cm, rigid, surfaces sparsely to densely
        pubescent, trichomes dendritic, margin and apex often with simple or forked ones; lobes
        (2–)3–4(–5) each side, with prominent midvein and narrow band of blade; terminal lobe
        (0.2–)0.4–0.7(–1) cm × (0.3–)0.5–1(–1.5) mm, as long as or slightly longer than adjacent
        lateral lobes. Fruiting pedicels (2–)4–7(–10) mm, sparsely pubescent or glabrous. Flowers:
        sepals 1.5–2 × 0.9–1.1 mm, hyaline-margined, glabrous or sparsely pubescent; petals 3–4 ×
        1.5–2 mm, attenuate to base; filaments 1.2–2 mm; anthers 0.4–0.5 mm. Fruits erect to
        ascending, (0.2–)0.4–1.3(–1.8) cm × 0.9–2 mm; style (0.2–)0.4–0.7(–1) mm. Seeds 0.7–0.9 ×
        0.3–0.5 mm.</description>

    <discussion>Polyctenium fremontii is highly variable in fruit size and the compactness of the
        fruiting raceme, but in habit, flower size and color, leaf morphology, indumentum, fruiting
        pedicel length and orientation, number of ovules per ovary, and basically every other aspect
        of the plants, it is quite constant. If one examines only the types of those two taxa and
        that of P. fremontii, it seems that perhaps two or three taxa might be recognized. Upon
        careful study of extensive material, one realizes that only one taxon, instead of three or
        more, is represented. The alleged differences between P. fremontii and P. williamsiae in
        characters other than fruit morphology do not hold. As for fruit size, it was said to be 2–4
        × 2–2.5 mm in P. williamsiae and (4–)6–13(–20) × 1–2 mm in P. fremontii. Fruit lengths in
        material annotated by Rollins as P. fremontii are 2–7 mm in Tiehm 8108 and 3.5–11 mm in
        Ertter 5726, both at GH. Furthermore, the compactness of the infructescence can be equally
        variable, and in the holotype of var. confertum there are 12–15 pedicels along 1 cm in the
        middle of the rachis, whereas in Ertter 5726 (GH) there are 6–12. On one sheet, Schoolcraft
        1287 (GH), compact and lax racemes and relatively short (3 mm) and longer (7 mm) fruits are
        represented. The variation in fruit length and width depends largely upon the number of
        ovules maturing into seeds, and in plants with very short fruits, including the type
        collection of P. williamsiae, none of the ovules matured into seeds, whereas in those with
        longest and narrowest fruits almost all ovules matured into seeds. Regardless of how long
        the fruit is or how many ovules mature into seeds, the ovule number is fairly constant
        throughout the range of the species. In my opinion, except for the type species of
        Polyctenium, all of the other taxa recognized in this genus do not represent biologically
        distinct entities.</discussion>
    <discussion>To my knowledge, Polyctenium fremontii is known from counties in California (Lassen,
        Modoc, Mono, Siskiyou), Idaho (Gooding), Nevada (Churchill, Douglas, Humboldt, Lyon,
        Mineral, Washoe), and Oregon (Crook, Deschutes, Harney, Klamath, Lake,
        Malheur).</discussion>
