  <description>Biennials or perennials; (short-lived); glaucous, glabrous (except petioles). Stems branched distally, 2–10 dm. Basal leaves: petiole (0.9–)1.4–3(–4.5) cm, ciliate; blade usually oblanceolate to oblong or lanceolate, rarely ovate or elliptic, (2.8–)3.5–8.8(–11) cm × (7–)10–25(–35) mm, margins often entire or repand, sometimes sinuate. Cauline leaves (ascending); sessile; blade lanceolate to oblong, 1.8–4.5(–6) cm × 5–16(–24) mm, (base amplexicaul to strongly auriculate), margins entire. Racemes lax, slightly elongated in fruit, (flower buds oblong-linear). Fruiting pedicels horizontal to divaricate, usually straight, rarely slightly incurved, slender, (2.5–)3–5.5(–6.5) mm, slightly flattened at base. Flowers: sepals erect, linear-oblong, 5–7(–8) × (0.8–)1–1.5(–1.8) mm; petals dark purple, spatulate to oblanceolate, (6.6–)7.5–10(–11.5) × 1–1.8(–2) mm, margins not crisped, claw differentiated from blade, [slender, (3–)3.5–5(–5.5) mm, narrowest at base]; nectar glands confluent, subtending bases of stamens; filaments subequal, (4.5–)6–9(–10) mm; anthers exserted, linear to narrowly oblong, 2.5–4(–4.5) mm, circinately coiled; gynophore (1–)2.5–6(–7.5) mm. Fruits divaricate to ascending, torulose, straight or slightly incurved, terete, (2–)2.4–5(–6.5) cm × 0.7–1(–1.3) mm; ovules 44–58 per ovary; style usually cylindrical, rarely subclavate, 0.5–1.5(–2) mm. Seeds 0.7–1.5 × 0.5–0.8 mm.</description>
