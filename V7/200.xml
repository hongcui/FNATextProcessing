Leaves: stipules with nectaries at growing tip; rachis articulation with stalked glands; [1-pinnate](2–)3–4(–5)-pinnate; leaflet blade membranous [subcoriaceous], [lanceolate, oblanceolate, linear] round or oval, venation sometimes conspicuous abaxially, apex glandular, surfaces [pubescent] puberulent or glabrous. Flowers: parts usually with hairs forming a barrier distal to the nectariferous hypanthium; 1 sporangium initiated in anther ontogeny. Capsules 2-valved, often constricted between seeds. Seeds [1]2–3 cm, winged [not winged], sometimes with spongy seed coat, shed by gravity. x = 11.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 13 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><introduced>introduced;</introduced><global_distribution>Asia (Bangladesh)</global_distribution><global_distribution>Asia (India)</global_distribution><global_distribution>Asia (Oman)</global_distribution><global_distribution>Asia (Pakistan)</global_distribution><global_distribution>Asia (Saudi Arabia)</global_distribution><global_distribution>Asia (Yemen)</global_distribution><global_distribution>sw</global_distribution><global_distribution>ne Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution>Indian Ocean Islands (Madagascar)</global_distribution><global_distribution>introduced also pantropically.</global_distribution><discussion>Little is known about breeding systems in Moringa; M. longituba Engler appears incapable of self-pollination, and flowers with sterile anthers have been reported in M. concanensis Nimmo ex Dalzell &amp; Gibson. All species are used medicinally locally; M. stenopetala (Baker f.) Cufodontis is used as a leaf vegetable in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.</discussion></treatment>
