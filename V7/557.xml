Stems 1–3 per caudex branch, arising from center of rosette near ground surface, or arising laterally proximal to sterile shoots, 1–2.5 dm, glabrous throughout. Basal leaves: blade narrowly oblanceolate, 1–3(–6) mm wide, margins usually entire, rarely apically few-toothed, not ciliate, surfaces sparsely pubescent, trichomes short-stalked, 4–8-rayed, 0.08–0.2 mm. Cauline leaves: 4–8, not concealing stem; blade auricles 1–2 mm, surfaces of distalmost leaves glabrous. Racemes 5–12(–18)-flowered, usually unbranched. Fruiting pedicels usually divaricate-ascending, rarely horizontal, straight, 2–5(–10) mm, glabrous. Flowers ascending at anthesis; sepals glabrous; petals lavender to purple, 4–5.5 × 1–1.5 mm, glabrous; pollen spheroid. Fruits usually divaricate-ascending, rarely horizontal, not appressed to rachis, secund (often weakly so), straight, edges parallel, 3–5.5 cm × 1.5–2 mm; valves glabrous; ovules 42–54 per ovary; style 0.05–0.1 mm. Seeds uniseriate, 1.1–1.5 × 0.9–1.3 mm; wing continuous, 0.1–0.3 mm wide.</description><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>rocky ridges</habitat><elevation>1500–2100 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Oreg.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Wash.</us_distribution><discussion>Morphological evidence suggests that Boechera paddoensis is an apomictic species that arose through hybridization between B. lemmonii and B. lyallii (see M. D. Windham and I. A. Al-Shehbaz 2007 for detailed comparison). Boechera paddoensis is known only from the mountains of central Washington and northeastern Oregon.</discussion></treatment>
