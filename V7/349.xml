  <discussion>Arabis olympica, which is known from two collections, J. B. Flett s.n. (holotype, US; isotype, WS) and N. Buckingham 1577 (WS) that were made from Jefferson and Clallam counties, respectively, was reduced by R. C. Rollins (1936, 1941, 1993) to a variety of A. furcata. An examination of the type collections of both species reveals that they are distinct. Although the fruits and seeds of A. olympica are not fully mature, they are clearly different in width and orientation from those of A. furcata at the same developmental stage. The striking differences in fruit width and orientation, stem indument, and seed and flower size support their maintenance as distinct species. Although both species grow in Washington, the range of A. olympica seems to be restricted to Clallam and Jefferson counties and is disjunct from Chelan, Kittitas, and Yakima counties, where A. furcata grows.</discussion>
