  <discussion>Reseda luteola is a traditional Old World dye plant, used since Roman times. It contains a high amount of the flavonoid luteolin, which yields one of the most brilliant yellow dyes. When combined with woad (Isatis tinctoria, Brassicaceae), it yields “Saxon Green.” In the nineteenth century R. luteola was widely growing, which favored its spreading through many parts of the world; today, it has fallen into disuse. Its potential as a crop for natural dyeing of textiles is being re-evaluated. It is also grown as an ornamental; the appealing rosettes of yellowish green leaves acquire a reddish blush in cool weather.</discussion>
