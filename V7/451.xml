Stems unbranched, 0.2–1.2 dm, sparsely pubescent proximally, trichomes short-stalked, 3–5- rayed, (non-crisped), 0.2–0.4 mm, glabrous distally. Basal leaves rosulate; subsessile or shortly petiolate; petiole base and margin ciliate proximally, (trichomes simple, subsetiform, stiff, 0.3–0.9 mm); blade oblanceolate to obovate, 0.4–1.5 cm × 1–3 mm, margins entire, surfaces pubescent, abaxially with stalked, 6–12-rayed, (non-crisped) trichomes, 0.2–0.5 mm, (midvein obscure), adaxially similar, or with simple trichomes on proximal 1/2. Cauline leaves 0 or 1; sessile; blade oblong to lanceolate, margins entire, surfaces pubescent as basal. Racemes 3–13-flowered, ebracteate, elongated in fruit; rachis not flexuous, glabrous. Fruiting pedicels divaricate-ascending, straight, 1–4(–8) mm, glabrous. Flowers: sepals ovate, 1.5–2 mm, pubescent, (trichomes simple and 2-rayed); petals white, spatulate, 2–4 × 1–1.7 mm; anthers ovate, ca. 0.2 mm. Fruits ovate to oblong, plane, flattened, 4–7.5 × 1.7–3 mm; valves glabrous; ovules 12–16 per ovary; style 0.1–0.3(–0.5) mm. Seeds ovoid, 0.7–1 × 0.5–0.6 mm. 2n = 32.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><habitat>rock outcrops</habitat><habitat>talus</habitat><habitat>meadows</habitat><habitat>gravel slopes</habitat><elevation>600–3000 m;</elevation><ca_distribution>Alta.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution>Yukon</ca_distribution><us_distribution>Alaska</us_distribution><us_distribution>Mont.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Wyo.</us_distribution><discussion>According to H. H. Grundt et al. (2004), tetraploid Draba porsildii probably originated from a diploid ancestor such as D. lonchocarpa. The Wyoming plants are a close match to the type of the species, though they have distinctly shorter pedicels. Some of the Alaskan plants are more problematic; they have finer and more branched trichomes, larger flowers, longer pedicels, and longer styles than the type. It is likely that they belong to another species; detailed molecular and cytological studies on this complex are needed before any meaningful conclusions are reached.</discussion></treatment>
