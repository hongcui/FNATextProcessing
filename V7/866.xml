Basal leaves: blade filiform to narrowly linear, 5–17 cm × 0.4–3 mm, (somewhat revolute, appearing terete), base attenuate, margins denticulate, apex subacuminate. Cauline leaves sessile; blade margins entire or remotely denticulate. Racemes considerably elongated in fruit. Fruiting pedicels divaricate to ascending, slender, narrower than fruit, 5–14 mm. Flowers: sepals oblong to linear-oblong, 7–11 mm, lateral pair saccate basally; petals orange-yellow to yellow, broadly obovate to suborbicular, 15–20(–25) × 5–10 mm, claw 6–13 mm, apex rounded; median filaments 7–14 mm; anthers linear, 2.3–3.5 mm. Fruits widely spreading to ascending, narrowly linear, curved or slightly twisted, somewhat torulose, (4–)7–12(–15) cm × 1.2–2.2(–2.5) mm, slightly latiseptate, not striped; valves with prominent midvein, pubescent outside, trichomes 2 and 3 (or 4)-rayed, glabrous inside; ovules 40–72 per ovary; style cylindrical, slender, 0.5–2(–2.5) mm, sparsely pubescent; stigma subentire to slightly 2-lobed, lobes as long as wide. Seeds ovoid, 1.5–2.3(–2.7) × 0.9–1.5 mm; wing appendage-like, distal. 2n = 36.</description>
