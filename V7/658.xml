  <description>Annuals or biennials [perennials]; (sometimes rhizomatous); not scapose; pubescent or
    glabrous. Stems erect or ascending, unbranched or branched distally. Leaves basal and cauline;
    petiolate or sessile; basal not rosulate, petiolate or sessile, blade (simple or pinnatisect
    with 1–6 leafletlike lobes on each side), margins crenate; cauline petiolate or sessile, blade
    (base sometimes auriculate or amplexicaul), margins entire, dentate, or, sometimes, with 1–4
    lateral lobes [crenate or serrate]. Racemes (corymbose, several-flowered). Fruiting pedicels
    divaricate-ascending [divaricate, recurved], slender or stout. Flowers: sepals erect
    [ascending], linear [oblong], lateral pair strongly [slightly] saccate basally; petals purple,
    lavender, or white, broadly obovate [narrowly obcordate], claw obscurely to considerably
    differentiated from blade ([shorter than] as long as sepals, apex rounded [emarginate]); stamens
    tetradynamous; filaments dilated basally; anthers linear [oblong], (apiculate); nectar glands
    (2), lateral, semiannular or annular. Fruits siliques, dehiscent, sessile or shortly stipitate,
    linear, torulose, terete or somewhat 4-angled; valves (leathery), each with prominent midvein,
    usually glabrous, rarely densely hirsute; replum rounded; septum complete; ovules [20–]40–70 per
    ovary; stigma capitate, 2-lobed (lobes distinct, decurrent). Seeds uniseriate, plump, not
    winged, oblong; seed coat (alveolate-reticulate), not mucilaginous when wetted; cotyledons
    conduplicate. x = 12.</description>

  <discussion>Orychophragmus is fairly similar to, and closely related to, Moricandia, and they can
    easily be misidentified. The former has petiolate, pinnately divided, broadly auriculate
    proximalmost leaves, non-cucullate median sepals, apiculate anthers, and non-connivent stigma
    lobes. By contrast, Moricandia has sessile, entire, non-auriculate proximalmost leaves,
    cucullate median sepals, non-apiculate anthers, and connivent stigma lobes.</discussion>
  <discussion>Orychophragmus limprichtianus (Pax) Al-Shehbaz &amp; G. Yang is cultivated as an
    ornamental, rarely escaping.</discussion>
