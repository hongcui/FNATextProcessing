  <discussion>Varieties 2 (2 in the flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>Salix rotundifolia is closely related to S. polaris, from which it can be separated by its glabrous ovaries and fewer-flowered catkins. They also differ somewhat in leaf venation: S. rotundifolia typically having three main veins arising from the leaf base, often only one or two pair of secondary veins, and no or indistinct tertiary veins; S. polaris typically having pinnate venation, multiple secondary veins, and distinct tertiary veins. Salix rotundifolia consists of two varieties, the diploid var. dodgeana and the hexaploid var. rotundifolia. In general, var. dodgeana is a high alpine species in the southern cordillera of Wyoming and Montana, the St. Elias Mountains in Alaska and Yukon, the Mackenzie Mountains, Northwest Territories, and the Richardson Mountains, Yukon Territory. A diploid specimen of S. rotundifolia in the Cherski Mountains, Yakutia, Russia (B. A. Jurtzev and P. G. Zhukova 1982), which fits var. dodgeana in its 2–3-flowered catkins, relatively small leaves (3.5 × 3.9 mm), and small stomata (490 µm2), may represent an ancestral population. Variety rotundifolia usually occurs at lower elevations in Alaska and in easternmost Chukotka and Wrangel Island, Russia, but elevation separation is not distinct. There is a general correlation between stomatal size and ploidal level (W. Buechler, pers. comm.), but relatively large stomata in some diploid specimens of S. rotundifolia indicates a need for further cytological study. For the present, it is best to recognize the two cytotypes as varieties.</discussion>
