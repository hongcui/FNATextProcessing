Stems simple from base, decumbent to nearly prostrate, 0.5–1.3 dm. Basal leaves (strongly rosulate; shortly petiolate); blade broadly obovate, 1.5–7.5 (width 7.5–26 mm, base gradually tapering to petiole), margins shallowly dentate, (apex obtuse). Cauline leaves: blade oblanceolate to broadly obovate, 1–2.5 cm, margins entire. Racemes dense. Fruiting pedicels (divaricate-ascending to widely spreading, slightly sigmoid to curved), 7–12 mm. Flowers: sepals (pale yellow or yellow-green), narrowly lanceolate to narrowly deltate, 4–8 mm; petals yellow, broadly spatulate to obovate, 9–13 mm, (not clawed). Fruits didymous, slightly flattened (contrary to replum) to uncompressed, 4–9 × 2–8 mm, (strongly coriaceous, apical and basal sinuses narrow, deep); valves (retaining seeds after dehiscence), pubescent, trichomes appressed; replum narrowly oblanceolate to narrowly linear-oblong, as wide as or wider than fruit, apex obtuse; ovules 4 per ovary; style more than 3 mm. Seeds compressed. 2n = 8.</description><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><habitat>dark shale</habitat><habitat>road cuts</habitat><habitat>ridge crests</habitat><habitat>washes</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>1500–1800 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Colo.</us_distribution><discussion>Physaria bellii is often found in shale and limestone soils of the Fountain/Ingleside, Lykins, Niobrara, and Pierre formations.
