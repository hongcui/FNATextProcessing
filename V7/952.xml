    <description>Perennials; (pulvinate, caudex woody, many-branched, covered with persistent
        petiolar remains); densely (grayish) puberulent. Stems simple from base (caudex branch),
        erect to ascending, un-branched distally, (0.1–)0.3–0.8 dm. Basal leaves not rosulate;
        petiole often undifferentiated, (expanded base to 2 mm); blade (somewhat fleshy), linear to
        linear-oblanceolate (when margins entire), or spatulate in outline (when apically 3–5-lobed,
        lobes obovate to oblong), 3–12(–15) cm × 5–15 mm, margins entire. Cauline leaves sessile;
        similar to basal, smaller, base not auriculate. Racemes slightly elongated in fruit; rachis
        puberulent, trichomes straight or curved, cylindrical. Fruiting pedicels
        divaricate-ascending to subhorizontal, straight or slightly curved, (not winged),
        (2.5–)3–5(–6.5) × 04–0.5 mm, densely puberulent throughout. Flowers: sepals orbicular to
        broadly obovate, 1.5–2(–2.5) × 1–1.5(–2) mm; petals white to pale purple, suborbicular to
        obovate, 2–3.5 × 1.5–2.5(–2.8) mm, claw to 0.5 mm; stamens 6; filaments 1.5–1.8 mm,
        (glabrous); anthers 0.3–0.5 mm. Fruits ovate, 2.5–3.5(–4) × 2–2.5(–3) mm, apically winged,
        apical notch 0.05–0.2 mm deep; valves thin, smooth, not veined, glabrous; style 0.3–0.6 mm,
        exserted beyond apical notch. Seeds ovate, 1.2–1.5 × 0.9–1.1 mm.</description>
