  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><common_name>Mountain-view bladderpod</common_name><description>Perennials; caudex branched, (densely cespitose and forming hemispheric mounds); densely pubescent, trichomes 5-rayed, rays bifurcate near base, fused at base, (strongly tuberculate throughout). Stems few to several from base, erect, (usually exceeding basal leaves), 0.3–0.7 dm. Basal leaves: blade linear-spatulate, 1.5–4 cm, (base narrowed gradually to petiole), margins entire. Cauline leaves: blade spatulate, similar to basal. Racemes crowded in distal 1/3, (4–10-flowered). Fruiting pedicels (loosely to strongly sigmoid), 6–10 mm. Flowers: sepals (pale yellow), oblong to elliptic, 3–4 mm, (median pair usually thickened apically, cucullate); petals (sometimes with slight tinge of orange basally), lingulate, 4–6 mm. Fruits ellipsoid, slightly inflated (somewhat latiseptate), 4–5 mm, (apex acute); valves pubescent, trichomes erect, appearing slightly shaggy; ovules 4–8 per ovary; styles 2.5–3 mm, (shorter than mature fruits). Seeds ± flattened, convex on outer side.</description><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><habitat>dry, windswept knolls of limestone gravel</habitat><habitat>with other cushion-forming plants</habitat><elevation>1600–2300 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Idaho</us_distribution><us_distribution>Mont.</us_distribution><discussion>Physaria pycnantha is morphologically similar to 56.
