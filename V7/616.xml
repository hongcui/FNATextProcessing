    <description>Annuals, biennials, or perennials [shrubs]; eglandular. Trichomes absent or simple.
        Cauline leaves petiolate or sessile; blade base auriculate or not, margins entire, dentate,
        serrate, or pinnately lobed. Racemes usually ebracteate, often elongated in fruit. Flowers
        actinomorphic; sepals erect, ascending, or spreading, lateral pair saccate or not basally;
        petals white, cream, yellow, pink, lilac, lavender, or purple, claw present, often distinct;
        filaments unappendaged, not winged; pollen 3-colpate. Fruits silicles or siliques, dehiscent
        or indehiscent, usually segmented, usually latiseptate or terete (subterete or 4-angled in
        Erucastrum) [angustiseptate]; ovules (1–)2–276[–numerous] per ovary; style usually distinct
        (absent in Cakile, obscure in Carrichtera, obsolete in Eruca); stigma entire or strongly
        2-lobed (sometimes slightly 2-lobed in Cakile). Seeds biseriate, uniseriate, or aseriate;
        cotyledons usually conduplicate, rarely accumbent or incumbent (in Cakile).</description>
