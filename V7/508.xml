    <description>Perennials; long-lived; (often cespitose); sexual; caudex somewhat woody. Stems
        usually 2–5 per caudex branch, arising from margin of rosette near ground surface, (1–)1.5–4
        dm, densely pubescent proximally, trichomes short-stalked, 5–8-rayed, 0.1–0.2 mm, moderately
        to sparsely pubescent distally. Basal leaves: blade narrowly oblanceolate, 1.5–3(–5) mm
        wide, margins entire, ciliate along petiole base, trichomes (simple), to 0.6 mm, surfaces
        densely pubescent, trichomes short-stalked, 5–8-rayed 0.1–0.2 mm. Cauline leaves: 5–14, not
        concealing stem; blade auricles 0.1–0.5 mm, surfaces of distalmost leaves pubescent. Racemes
        10–30-flowered, usually unbranched. Fruiting pedicels ascending to divaricate-ascending,
        straight, 5–10 mm, pubescent, trichomes branched. Flowers ascending at anthesis; sepals
        pubescent; petals usually white, 5–7 × 1–2 mm, glabrous; pollen ellipsoid. Fruits ascending
        to divaricate-ascending, not appressed to rachis, not secund, straight, edges parallel,
        3–5.5 cm × 0.9–1.2 mm; valves glabrous; ovules 56–84 per ovary; style 0.1–0.5 mm. Seeds
        uniseriate, 0.8–1 × 0.6–0.9 mm; wing continuous (rarely absent), to 0.1 mm wide. 2n =
        14.</description>

    <discussion>Boechera crandallii is a sexual diploid known only from the Gunnison Basin of
        west-central Colorado. Despite its narrow range, the species appears to hybridize
        frequently, most notably with B. pallidifolia.</discussion>
