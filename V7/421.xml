  <discussion>T. W. Böcher (1966) postulated that Draba lactea originated from hybridization between D. fladnizensis and D. nivalis, but A.-C. Scheen et al. (2002) showed that it is more closely allied to D. subcapitata. By contrast, H. H. Grundt et al. (2004) concluded that hexaploid D. lactea originated from tetraploids of the same species, which in turn originated from the diploid D. palanderiana lineage. They suggested that D. lactea probably originated multiple times in the Beringian area and migrated to reach its present circumpolar distribution. The hexaploids are distributed throughout the species range, whereas the tetraploids are known only from Alaska and the Russian Far East (Grundt et al. 2005b).</discussion>
  <discussion>Draba fernaldiana, which was collected from Southampton Island (Nunavut), was not mentioned by R. C. Rollins (1993). The plants are completely glabrous except for leaf margins, which are ciliate with simple and sparse 2-rayed trichomes. The taxon resembles some forms of D. lactea and is tentatively herein included within that species. The only conflict in such placement is petal color, which was listed in the original description of D. fernaldiana as pale yellow instead of white.</discussion>
  <discussion>Glabrous or glabrescent forms of Draba lactea are quite common in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, whereas pubescent forms predominate in Alaska and the Russian Far East.</discussion>
