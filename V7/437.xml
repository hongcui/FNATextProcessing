  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Perennials; (stoloniferous); cau-dex branched (sparsely covered with petiole remains, branches slender, creeping, loosely matted); often scapose. Stems unbranched, 0.4–1.5 dm, gla-brous or pubescent throughout, trichomes simple and short-stalked, 2- or 3-rayed, 0.1–0.5 mm. Basal leaves not rosulate; (subopposite); petiolate; petiole base and margin ciliate or not, (trichomes simple, 0.2–0.8 mm); blade oblanceolate or lanceolate, 0.5–1.5 cm × 1.5–5 mm, margins entire, surfaces glabrous or sparsely pubescent with simple and stalked, 2–4-rayed trichomes, 0.1–0.5 mm, (midvein obscure abaxially). Cauline leaves (0 or) 1 or 2; (subopposite); sessile; blade ovate or oblong, margins entire, surfaces pubescent as basal. Racemes 5–13-flowered, ebracteate, elongated in fruit; rachis not or slightly flexuous, glabrous or pubescent as stem. Fruiting pedicels horizontal to divaricate, often curved upward, 6–13(–17) mm, glabrous or sparsely pubescent, trichomes simple and 2-rayed. Flowers: sepals ovate, 2–3 mm, glabrous or pubescent, (trichomes simple); petals golden yellow, obovate, 3.5–6 × 2–3 mm; anthers ovate, 0.3–0.5 mm. Fruits oblong, plane, flattened, 6–9 × 2–3 mm; valves glabrous; ovules 8–20 per ovary; style 0.4–1 mm. Seeds ovoid, 0.9–1 × ca. 0.6 mm. 2n = 16.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>tundra</habitat><habitat>river flats and banks</habitat><habitat>exposed talus slopes</habitat><habitat>hummocks in wet sedge meadows</habitat><elevation>900–2200 m;</elevation><ca_distribution>N.W.T.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution>Yukon</ca_distribution><us_distribution>Alaska.</us_distribution><discussion>The limits of Draba ogilviensis were confused by authors who reduced it to synonymy of D. juvenilis or D. sibirica. A thorough discussion of the three species and their distinguishing characteristics was provided by D. F. Murray and C. L. Parker (1999).</discussion></treatment>
