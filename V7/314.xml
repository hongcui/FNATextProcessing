  <description>Herbs, annual [perennial]. Stems unbranched or sparsely branched; glabrate or glandular-pubescent. Leaves: stipules absent; petiole with pulvinus basally or distally, (petiolule base adnate, forming pulvinar disc); leaflets 3 or 5. Inflorescences terminal, racemes (elongated); bracts present. Flowers zygomorphic; sepals persistent, distinct, equal (each often subtending a nectary); petals equal; stamens 6; filaments adnate basally to gynophore (about as long as petals), glabrous; anthers coiling as pollen is released; gynophore recurved in fruit (filament scars visible ca. 1/3–1/2 its length). Fruits capsules, dehiscent, oblong. Seeds 10–20[–40], subglobose, not arillate, (cleft fused between ends). x = 10, 17.</description>

  <discussion>Gynandropsis is allied to Cleome; it is distinguished by relatively long androgynophores. It has been included in Cleome; most regional accounts of Cleomaceae (including Capparaceae) in the Old World have given this taxon generic status, an approach followed here.</discussion>
