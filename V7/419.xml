  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Perennials; (cespitose); caudex branched (with persistent leaf remains); not scapose. Stems unbranched, 0.1–0.35 dm, pilose throughout, trichomes simple, (slightly crisped), 0.4–0.9 mm. Basal leaves rosulate; petiolate; petiole base and margin ciliate, (trichomes usually simple, rarely some 2-rayed, 0.2–0.7 mm); blade oblanceolate to linear-oblanceolate, 0.6–1.5 cm × 0.5–2 mm, margins entire or sparsely dentate, surfaces pubescent, abaxially with simple trichomes, 0.3–0.9 mm, with fewer, 2(or 3)-rayed ones, 0.07–0.3 mm, adaxially with simple trichomes. Cauline leaves 1–3; sessile; blade lanceolate, margins entire, surfaces pubescent as basal. Racemes 2–7-flowered, ebracteate or proximalmost 1 or 2 flowers bracteate, slightly elongated in fruit; rachis not flexuous, glabrous. Fruiting pedicels divaricate-ascending, straight, 1–2 mm, glabrous. Flowers: sepals ovate, 0.7–1.3 mm, subapically sparsely pubescent, (trichomes simple); petals white, spatulate, 1.5–2 × 0.4–0.8 mm; anthers ovate, 0.2–0.3 mm. Fruits lanceolate, plane, flattened, 3–4 × 1–1.5 mm; valves pubescent, trichomes simple, 0.7–0.2 mm; ovules 14–16 per ovary; style 0.1–0.25 mm. Seeds oblong, ca. 0.6 × 0.4 mm.</description><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><habitat>rocky alpine slopes</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>ca. 2000 m;</elevation><ca_distribution>Yukon.</ca_distribution><discussion>Draba kluanei is known only from the type collection made in Kluane National Park, southwestern Yukon Territory.</discussion></treatment>
