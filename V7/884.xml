Al-Shehbaz</author><description>Annuals; not scapose; scabrous, trichomes stalked, 2-forked, submalpighiaceous, mixed with fewer, simple, and, rarely, 3-forked ones, usually different sizes. Stems erect or ascending, unbranched or branched. Leaves basal and cauline; petiolate, sessile, or subsessile; basal (often withered by flowering), not rosulate, petiolate, blade margins entire, dentate, or repand, rarely pinnatifid; cauline sessile or subsessile, blade similar to basal, margins entire, dentate, or repand. Racemes (corymbose), elongated in fruit. Fruiting pedicels erect, stout. Flowers: sepals ovate to oblong; petals white, narrowly spatulate, (slightly longer than sepals), claw slightly differentiated from blade (shorter than sepals, apex emarginate); stamens slightly tetradynamous; filaments not dilated basally; anthers ovate, (apiculate); nectar glands (4), lateral, 1 on each side of lateral stamen. Fruits silicles (nutletlike), indehiscent, sessile, ovoid, subterete to slightly 4-angled; valves not veined, (thickened, woody), scabrous; replum strongly expanded laterally; septum complete, (thickened); ovules 2 per ovary, (subapical); style (persistent), obsolete or distinct; stigma capitate, 2-lobed (lobes not decurrent). Seeds aseriate, plump, not winged, oblong; seed coat (smooth), not mucilaginous when wetted; cotyledons accumbent or obliquely so.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 1:</number_of_infrataxa><introduced>introduced;</introduced><global_distribution>e Europe</global_distribution><global_distribution>c</global_distribution><global_distribution>w Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution>introduced also in Australia.</global_distribution></treatment>
