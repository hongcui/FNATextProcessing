  <discussion>Although Draba kananaskis and D. longipes have often been treated as distinct species, we find no basis for maintaining them. Both exhibit variations in petal color (white to pale yellow) and leaf trichomes (short-stalked to sessile) characteristic of D. juvenilis from the Russian Far East. Perhaps most importantly, all three are octoploids (2n = 64) with x = 8. We conclude that D. kananaskis is nothing more than a minor variant of D. juvenilis and it is treated herein, for the first time, as a synonym of that species.</discussion>
  <discussion>Draba juvenilis is occasionally confused with D. borealis, which also has stalked, cruciform trichomes with unbranched rays. Typical D. juvenilis is easily distinguished from that species by having narrower (2–3 mm) fruits that are glabrous (rarely pubescent) and untwisted, and 0–2 (or 3)-leaved stems. By contrast, D. borealis has wider (2.5–4.5 mm) fruits that are usually pubescent and/or twisted (rarely neither) and (2 or) 3–7(–12)-leaved stems.</discussion>
