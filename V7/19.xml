Leaves: stipules absent or rudimentary on early ones, foliaceous on late ones, apex rounded; petiole (shallowly grooved adaxially), 13–20 mm, puberulent or velvety adaxially; largest medial blade narrowly oblong, oblong, lanceolate, or narrowly ovate, 100–170 × 38–55 mm, 2.5–3(–4) times as long as wide, base rounded, convex, or subcordate (cordate on larger leaves), margins serrulate or spinulose-serrulate, apex acute, acuminate, or convex, abaxial surface sparsely tomentose, hairs straight, adaxial highly glossy, sparsely villous or pilose to glabrescent (midrib remaining villous), hairs white and ferruginous; proximal blade margins entire; juvenile blade sparsely pubescent to very densely villous or pilose abaxially, hairs white. Catkins: staminate 29–72 × 12–15 mm, flowering branchlet 1–10 mm; pistillate 50–81 × 17–27 mm, flowering branchlet 5–30 mm; floral bract (tawny, sometimes greenish), 2–3.6 mm, apex rounded, entire, abaxially sparsely hairy, hairs wavy; pistillate bract persistent after flowering. Staminate flowers: abaxial nectary 0.4–0.8 mm, adaxial nectary ovate, 0.5–1.1 mm, nectaries distinct or connate and cup-shaped; stamens 3–7; filaments hairy basally; anthers 0.4–0.5 mm. Pistillate flowers: adaxial nectary square, 0.5–0.9 mm; stipe 3.2–5.6 mm; ovary obclavate to ellipsoidal, (rarely puberulent), beak gradually tapering to styles; ovules 4 per ovary; styles 0.3–0.4 mm; stigmas 0.16–0.17–0.2 mm. Capsules 6–7 mm. 2n = 38.</description><phenology>feb</phenology><phenology>winter</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><habitat>swamps</habitat><habitat>marshy shores of streams in woodlands</habitat><habitat>calcareous areas</habitat><habitat>shade tolerant</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>10–40 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ala.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Fla.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Ga.</us_distribution><discussion>The closest relatives of Salix floridana are in the Old World sect.
