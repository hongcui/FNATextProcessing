    <description>Perennials; (flowering in the first year); caudex branched, (well-developed);
        densely pubescent, trichomes (subsessile, appressed to spreading), 3–6-rayed, rays furcate
        or bifurcate, usually slightly fused at base, less frequently distinct. Stems few to several
        from base, ascending (in flower) to nearly prostrate (in fruit), (unbranched), 1–2.5 dm.
        Basal leaves: (petiole 1–3.5 cm); blade ovate to rhombic or rotund, 2–7 cm, (base narrowed
        abruptly to petiole), margins usually entire, occasionally shallowly repand, (flat). Cauline
        leaves: blade elliptic or narrowly so, (0.7–)1–2.5 cm, (base narrowed gradually to petiole),
        margins entire. Racemes dense, (elongated in fruit). Fruiting pedicels (ascending, curved to
        slightly sigmoid), (4–)6–12 mm, (stout). Flowers: sepals (lavender under grayish trichomes),
        elliptic, 4–6 mm; petals (white, pale yellow basally, often tinged lavender abaxially),
        narrowly spatulate, 6–10 mm, (claw undifferentiated from blade). Fruits subglobose to ovoid,
        slightly compressed, 5–7 mm; valves densely pubescent, trichomes spreading; ovules 8–12 per
        ovary; style 4–6 mm. Seeds flattened, (faintly margined).</description>
