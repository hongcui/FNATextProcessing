Stems erect, branched distally. Leaves basal and cauline; petiolate or sessile; basal (withered by flowering), not rosulate, petiolate, blade margins lobed or not; cauline petiolate (petioles winged) or sessile, blade (base auriculate), margins dentate, entire, or lyrately lobed. Racemes (lax), considerably elongated in fruit. Fruiting pedicels divaricate to ascending, slender or stout. Flowers: sepals erect to ascending, oblong, lateral pair not or slightly saccate basally; petals purple, pink, or white, spatulate, (longer than sepals), claw differentiated from blade; stamens tetradynamous; filaments not dilated basally; anthers linear to narrowly oblong, (apiculate); nectar glands: lateral annular, median glands confluent with lateral. Fruits siliques, sessile or shortly stipitate, linear, smooth, terete; valves each with distinct midvein, glabrous; replum rounded; septum complete; ovules 22–36 per ovary; style distinct; stigma capitate. Seeds uniseriate, plump, not winged, oblong; seed coat (minutely reticulate), not mucilaginous when wetted; cotyledons accumbent.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 1:</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>c</global_distribution><global_distribution>e United States.</global_distribution><discussion>R. C. Rollins (1993) recognized four species in Iodanthus, of which three are endemic to Mexico. As summarized by R. A. Price and I. A. Al-Shehbaz (2001), molecular data clearly support treatment of the genus as monospecific and closely allied to Cardamine, as well as recognition of the three Mexican species as members of Chaunanthus, a genus unrelated to Iodanthus and members of the Thelypodieae.</discussion><references>
