Stems unbranched or branched, (few, glaucous), 6–15(–18) dm. Basal leaves often rosulate; petiolate; blade (fleshy), ob-lanceolate to obovate, 3.5–21 cm, margins dentate, (bristly ciliate throughout or only teeth and petiole ciliate). Cauline leaves: blade lanceolate to narrowly ovate, 3.5–11(–15) cm × 6–14 mm (smaller distally), base auriculate to amplexicaul, margins usually entire or undulate, rarely dentate. Racemes ebracteate, (with densely clustered buds, later lax). Fruiting pedicels divaricate-ascending, (straight), 5–18 mm. Flowers: calyx campanulate; sepals (suberect), purple, (broadly ovate or oblong), 7–10 mm, not keeled, (apically bristly or not); petals light purple (with pale yellow claw), 9–12 mm, blade 2–3.5 × 0.5–1 mm, margins not crisped, claw 6–9 mm, wider than blade; stamens tetradynamous; filaments: median pairs (distinct), 6–8 mm, lateral pair 4–6 mm; anthers (all) fertile, 3–4 mm; gynophore 0.5–1.5 mm. Fruits spreading to ascending, smooth, slightly curved to straight, flattened, 6–14 cm × 2–3.5 mm; valves each with obscure midvein; replum straight; ovules 50–102 per ovary; style 1–3 mm; stigma 2-lobed. Seeds oblong, 2–3 × 1.4–2 mm; wing 0.1–0.2 mm wide at apex.</description><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><habitat>rocky openings in chaparral</habitat><habitat>open conifer forests</habitat><habitat>openings and after fires in chaparral-oak woodlands</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>900–2300 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><global_distribution>Mexico (Baja California).</global_distribution><discussion>Streptanthus campestris is distributed in California in Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties, and in Baja California in Sierra San Pedro Mártir and Sierra Juárez.</discussion></treatment>
