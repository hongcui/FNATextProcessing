  <discussion>Draba viridis has been reported from the Huachuca and Santa Catalina mountains in southern Arizona, and the adjacent San Jose Mountains in Sonora, Mexico. It was reduced to a variety of D. petrophila by Hitchcock and a form of D. helleriana by O. E. Schulz, but is easily separated from both (I. A. Al-Shehbaz and M. D. Windham 2007).</discussion>
