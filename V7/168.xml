Leaves: stipules (not adnate to petioles), rudimentary or absent on early ones, (late ones sometimes brownish, linear, 5.4–10.4 mm), apex acuminate; petiole shallowly grooved adaxially, 4–13 mm, villous, puberulent, or velvety adaxially; largest medial blade linear, lorate, narrowly oblong, or narrowly elliptic, 53–130 × 5–33 mm, base cuneate, margins strongly revolute, sinuate or apparently entire, (glands epilaminal), apex acuminate, acute, or convex, abaxial surface apparently glaucous (obscured by hairs), densely short-silky, woolly, or tomentose, (midribs prominent, yellowish, and hairy), hairs appressed, spreading or erect, straight or wavy, adaxial dull or slightly glossy, sparsely or moderately densely pubescent, hairs gray; proximal blade margins entire; juvenile blade yellowish green, very densely tomentose or short-silky abaxially, hairs white. Catkins flowering just before or as leaves emerge; staminate stout, 24–48 mm, flowering branchlet 0–2 mm; pistillate densely flowered, 23–55 mm, flowering branchlet 0–6 mm; floral bract brown or tawny, 1.6–2.2 mm, apex convex or rounded, abaxially hairy, hairs straight. Staminate flowers: adaxial nectary narrowly oblong or oblong, 0.6–1.5 mm; filaments distinct; anthers purple turning yellow, ellipsoid to shortly cylindrical, 0.6–0.8 mm. Pistillate flowers: adaxial nectary narrowly oblong or oblong, 0.9–1.4 mm; ovary pyriform, beak gradually tapering to styles; ovules 12–18 per ovary; styles 0.6–1.8 mm. Capsules 4–6 mm. 2n = 38.</description><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><habitat>sandy, open woods</habitat><habitat>cobble rivershores</habitat><habitat>lake margins</habitat><habitat>and roadsides</habitat><elevation>0–300 m;</elevation><introduced>introduced;</introduced><ca_distribution>N.B.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution>Nfld. and Labr.
