Al-Shehbaz</author><description>Biennials or, rarely, perennials (short-lived); not scapose; (glaucous distally), glabrous or pubescent (mostly proximally), trichomes simple and/or stalked, forked, or substellate. Stems erect, unbranched basally, often branched distally. Leaves basal and cauline; petiolate or sessile; basal rosulate, petiolate, margins usually dentate, sinuate, repand, or pinnatifid, rarely entire; cauline blade (base auriculate or sagittate [amplexicaul]), margins dentate or entire. Racemes (corymbose), considerably elongated in fruit. Fruiting pedicels erect [divaricate], (appressed to rachis), slender. Flowers: sepals erect, oblong or linear, (margins membranous); petals usually yellowish or creamy white, rarely pink [purplish], usually narrowly spatulate or linear-oblanceolate, rarely linear, claw not differentiated from blade, (apex obtuse); stamens (erect), tetradynamous; filaments not dilated basally; anthers narrowly oblong [linear], (apex obtuse); nectar glands confluent, subtending bases of stamens, lateral glands annular, median glands present. Fruits siliques, dehiscent, sessile, linear, smooth, often subterete-quadrangular, (leathery); valves each with prominent midvein, glabrous; replum rounded; septum complete, (membranous, veinless); ovules 130–200 per ovary; (style distinct, short, stout); stigma capitate, (subentire). Seeds biseriate, flattened, not winged or, rarely, narrowly winged, oblong or subglobose [elliptic, orbicular]; seed coat not mucilaginous when wetted; cotyledons accumbent. x = 6, 8.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 2 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>North America</global_distribution><global_distribution>Eurasia</global_distribution><global_distribution>n Africa.</global_distribution><discussion>Turritis laxa (Smith) Hayek is distributed in eastern Europe and the Middle East.</discussion><references>
