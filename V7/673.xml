Al-Shehbaz</author><description>Plants not scapose. Stems erect to ascending, unbranched or branched. Leaves basal and cauline; petiolate or sessile; basal usually rosulate, petiolate, blade margins dentate to lyrate-pinnatifid; cauline blade (base sagittate or amplexicaul), margins dentate or subentire. Racemes (corymbose, several-flowered), considerably elongated in fruit. Fruiting pedicels divaricate or ascending, slender. Flowers: sepals ascending to spreading; petals oblanceolate, (apex obtuse or slightly emarginate); stamens slightly tetradynamous; filaments dilated basally; anthers ovate; nectar glands: lateral intrastaminal, median glands present (distinct). Fruits subsessile or shortly stipitate (gynophore relatively slender, fruit readily detached at maturity), nutlike, ovoid or ellipsoid, terete; valves reticulate and usually longitudinally 4-ribbed; replum rounded; septum absent; stigma capitate. Seeds (pendulous) plump, not winged, ovoid; seed coat (smooth), not mucilaginous when wetted; cotyledons involute in distal 1/2. x = 7.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 2 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><introduced>introduced;</introduced><global_distribution>Europe</global_distribution><global_distribution>e</global_distribution><global_distribution>c</global_distribution><global_distribution>sw Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution>n Africa.</global_distribution><discussion>Calepina cochlearioides (Murray) Dumortier is distributed in Asia (China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and adjacent Russia).</discussion><references>
