Leaves basal and cauline; petiolate; basal not rosulate, long-petiolate, (soon withered); cauline petiolate, blade (base hastate, not auriculate), margins entire or proximalmost lobed. Racemes (reflexed at anthesis, several-flowered, lax, proximal flowers sometimes bracteate), considerably elongated in fruit. Fruiting pedicels straight or curved upward, stout. Flowers: sepals ascending, narrowly lanceolate, lateral pair not saccate basally; petals (ascending), white, linear, (only slightly longer than sepals, slightly crisped), claw obovate or oblanceolate, (distinctly wider than blade); stamens subequal (well-exserted beyond petals); filaments slightly dilated basally; anthers linear, (apiculate, coiled after dehiscence); nectar glands confluent, lateral annular or semi-annular, median glands present. Fruits long-stipitate, linear, subtorulose, subterete or slightly compressed; valves each with prominent midvein extending full-length; replum rounded; septum complete; ovules 40â€“60 per ovary; style obsolete or distinct; stigma capitate, entire. Seeds uniseriate, plump, winged distally, oblong; seed coat not mucilaginous when wetted; cotyledons obliquely accumbent.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 1:</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>w United States.</global_distribution></treatment>
