Stems usually 1 per caudex branch, arising from center of rosette, elevated above ground surface on woody base, (2–)3.5–13 dm, densely pubescent proximally, trichomes short-stalked, 2–4-rayed, 0.3–0.9 mm, moderately to sparsely pubescent distally. Basal leaves: blade linear to oblanceolate, 3–10(–13) mm wide, margins entire or denticulate, ciliate along petiole, trichomes to 1.3 mm, surfaces densely pubescent, trichomes short-stalked, 4–8-rayed, 0.2–0.5 mm. Cauline leaves: 12–35(–55), often concealing stem proximally; blade auricles 1–5(–6) mm, surfaces of distalmost leaves pubescent. Racemes 30–120-flowered, usually unbranched. Fruiting pedicels descending to horizontal, usually recurved, rarely straight, 4–20 mm, pubescent, trichomes appressed, 3–7-rayed. Flowers divaricate-ascending at anthesis; sepals pubescent; petals usually purple, rarely pinkish, 9–14 × 1.5–3 mm, glabrous or sparsely pubescent (trichomes scattered abaxially); pollen spheroid. Fruits widely pendent, not appressed to rachis, not secund, usually curved, rarely straight, edges parallel, (6–)8–12 cm × 1.5–2.5 mm; valves glabrous or trichomes sometimes scattered; ovules 140–180 per ovary; style 0.05–0.3 mm. Seeds uniseriate or sub-biseriate, 1.7–2 × 1.2–1.7 mm; wing continuous, 0.2–0.4 mm wide.</description><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><habitat>rocky slopes and gravelly soil in desert chaparral and oak woodlands</habitat><elevation>300–2300 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><global_distribution>Mexico (Baja California).</global_distribution><discussion>Morphological evidence suggests that Boechera californica is an apomictic species that arose through hybridization between B. arcuata and B. pulchra (see M. D. Windham and I. A. Al-Shehbaz 2007 for detailed comparison). In the flora area, B. californica is known only from Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego counties.</discussion></treatment>
