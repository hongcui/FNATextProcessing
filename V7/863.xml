  <description>Perennials or, rarely, biennials; (caudex slender). Trichomes of leaves 2–5-rayed.
        Stems erect, unbranched or branched (few to several) basally, 0.4–6.5 dm. Basal leaves:
        blade spatulate to broadly oblanceolate, 2.5–7 cm × 3–10 mm, base attenuate, margins dentate
        or subentire, apex often obtuse, (surfaces pubescent adaxially, trichomes 2 or 3–5-rayed).
        Cauline leaves (distal) sessile; blade margins often entire. Racemes considerably elongated
        in fruit. Fruiting pedicels divaricate-ascending, slender, narrower than fruit, 4–12 mm.
        Flowers: sepals linear-oblong to oblong, 8–12 mm, lateral pair saccate basally; petals
        yellow, broadly obovate to suborbicular, 15–22 × 3.5–6 mm, claw 8–14 mm, apex rounded;
        median filaments 7–14 mm; anthers linear, 3–4 mm. Fruits erect to ascending, narrowly
        linear, straight, torulose, 3.8–14 cm × 1.2–3 mm, latiseptate, not striped; valves with
        prominent midvein, pubescent outside, trichomes 2 or 3 (or 4)-rayed, glabrous inside; ovules
        26–44 per ovary; style cylindrical, slender, (1.5–)2–5.5 mm, sparsely pubescent; stigma
        subentire to slightly 2-lobed, lobes as long as wide. Seeds ovoid, 2–3.4 × 1–2 mm; not
        winged or, rarely, winged distally. 2n = 36.</description>

  <discussion>Erysimum perenne is a high alpine species of the western sierras in California from
        Fresno, Inyo, and Madera counties northward into Plumas, Siskiyou, and Trinity counties. Its
        range in Nevada appears to be restricted to Douglas and Washoe counties.</discussion>
  <discussion>The limits of Erysimum perenne have been controversial, and it is with some
        hesitation that I recognize it as a species. G. B. Rossbach (1958) accepted it as a distinct
        species, R. A. Price (1993) transferred it (invalidly) to a subspecies of E. capitatum, R.
        C. Rollins (1993) treated it as a variety of E. capitatum, and N. H. Holmgren (2005b)
        treated the name as a synonym of E. capitatum. It is readily distinguished from E. capitatum
        by having torulose (versus not torulose) and flattened (versus 4-angled or flattened)
        fruits, slender (versus stout or, rarely, slender) and longer styles (1.5–)2–5.5 mm (versus
        0.2–2.5(–3) mm), and yellow (versus orange to, rarely, yellow) petals. Where the two species
        are allopatric, they remain consistently distinct, but at lower elevations, where their
        ranges overlap, the distinction becomes blurred. In such areas of overlap, one finds fruit
        variation ranging from distinctly torulose to non-torulose, as well as continuity in the
        other characters above.</discussion>
