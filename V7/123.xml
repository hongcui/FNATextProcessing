  <description>Shrubs or trees, 0.2–8 m. Buds alba-type and intermediate. Leaves: stipules on late
        ones foliaceous; largest medial blade (rarely amphistomatous), 2–8 times as long as wide,
        adaxial surface not glaucous. Staminate flowers: filaments glabrous or hairy basally.
        Pistillate flowers: adaxial nectary shorter than stipe; stipe 0.6–4.2 mm; ovary glabrous;
        stigmas with flat, non-papillate abaxial surface, or stigmas cylindrical, or plump, 0.1–0.4
        mm.</description>

  <discussion>All of the species in sect. Cordatae, with the exception of Salix turnorii, were
        treated by R. D. Dorn (1995) as subspecies or varieties of S. eriocephala. These taxa have
        relatively distinct ranges and, although they hybridize where they come into contact, their
        integrity is not jeopardized. For those reasons, they are treated here as
        species.</discussion>
