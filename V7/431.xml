  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Perennials; (cespitose); caudex often branched (covered with persistent leaves or leaf remains, branches sometimes terminating in sterile rosettes); not scapose. Stems unbranched, (0.4–)0.9–2.7(–3.5) dm, pubescent proxi-mally, glabrous distally, trichomes simple, 0.2–1 mm, and often smaller, fewer short-stalked, 2–4-rayed ones. Basal leaves rosulate; petiolate; petiole (0–0.7 cm), margin ciliate; blade oblanceolate to obovate, (0.3–)0.6–2.1(–2.8) cm × (1.5–)2.5–5(–9) mm, margins entire or sparsely denticulate, (ciliate, trichomes simple, 0.2–1.1 mm), surfaces pubescent with stalked, cruciform, and 2- or 3-rayed trichomes, (rays sometimes spurred), 0.1–0.6 mm, sometimes mostly simple trichomes adaxially. Cauline leaves 1–6; sessile; blade ovate or oblong to lanceolate, margins usually entire, rarely sparsely denticulate, surfaces pubescent as basal. Racemes 7–25-flowered, ebracteate, elongated in fruit; rachis not flexuous, glabrous. Fruiting pedicels divaricate-ascending, usually straight, rarely curved, (4–)7–18 mm, glabrous. Flowers: sepals ovate, 1.5–2.2 mm, pubescent, (trichomes simple and short-stalked, 2-rayed); petals white, obovate, 4–6 × 1.5–2.5 mm; anthers ovate, 0.4–0.5 mm. Fruits linear-lanceolate to narrowly elliptic, plane, flattened, 5–13 × 1.5–2 mm; valves glabrous; ovules 20–30 per ovary; style 0.6–1.5 mm. Seeds oblong, 0.9–1.2 × ca. 0.5 mm. 2n = 48.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><habitat>rock outcrops and talus</habitat><habitat>open forests</habitat><habitat>dry slopes</habitat><habitat>alluvial gravels</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>150–900 m;</elevation><ca_distribution>Yukon</ca_distribution><us_distribution>Alaska.</us_distribution></treatment>
