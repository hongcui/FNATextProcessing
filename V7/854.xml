  <description>Biennials or perennials; (caudex thickened, usually simple, rarely branched). Trichomes of leaves 2- (or 3-) rayed. Stems erect, unbranched or branched basally and/or distally, (0.8–)1.5–7(–9.4) dm. Basal leaves: blade oblanceolate to linear-oblanceolate, 2–7 cm × 2–7 mm, base attenuate, margins entire or denticulate, apex acute. Cauline leaves sessile; blade margins entire or denticulate. Racemes (densely flowered), elongated or not in fruit. Fruiting pedicels usually ascending, rarely divaricate-ascending, stout, slightly narrower than fruit, (often crowded), 4–7(–10) mm. Flowers: sepals linear-oblong, 5–8 mm, lateral pair saccate basally; petals yellow, narrowly obovate to spatulate, (8–)10–15 × (2–)2.5–4 mm, claw 6–9 mm, apex rounded; median filaments 6–10 mm; anthers narrowly linear, 1.7–2 mm. Fruits suberect to ascending, (subappressed to rachis or not), narrowly linear, straight, not torulose, 2.5–5.8(–6.4) cm × 1.8–2.5 mm, slightly 4-angled, not striped; valves with somewhat prominent midvein, pubescent outside, trichomes 2–4-rayed, glabrous inside; ovules 40–56 per ovary; style stout, 0.5–1.5 mm, moderately to sparsely pubescent; stigma strongly 2-lobed, lobes as long as wide. Seeds ovoid to oblong, 1.5–2 × 1–1.2 mm; not winged. 2n = 54.</description>

  <discussion>Both G. B. Rossbach (1958, 1958b) and R. C. Rollins (1993) treated Erysimum coarctatum as a variety of E. inconspicuum. However, the morphological and cytological (G. A. Mulligan 2002) differences clearly support its maintenance as a distinct species. The vast majority of the collections from Yukon belong to E. coarctatum, and the species is reported herein from Alberta [Banff, Clark s.n., July-August (GH)] for the first time. The records from Alaska are based on Scamman 5062 (GH) from Eklutna Lake and Wiggins 12886 (GH) from Umiat on Colville River.</discussion>
