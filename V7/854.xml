  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Biennials or perennials; (short-lived). Trichomes of leaves 2- or 3(–7)-rayed. Stems erect, unbranched or branched distally, 0.4–5(–7) dm. Basal leaves: blade (slightly fleshy), spatulate to oblanceolate, 2–11 cm × 4–20 mm, base attenuate, margins sinuate-dentate to coarsely dentate, apex rounded to subacute. Cauline leaves (distal) sessile; blade margins entire or denticulate. Racemes considerably elongated in fruit. Fruiting pedicels ascending, stout, narrower than fruit, 2–4(–6) mm. Flowers: sepals oblong, 8–19 mm, lateral pair saccate basally; petals yellow to cream, suborbicular to broadly obovate, 15–32 × 6–16 mm, claw 8–12 mm, apex rounded; median filaments 8–11 mm; anthers linear, 3–4 mm. Fruits usually ascending to suberect, rarely divaricate-ascending, narrowly linear, straight or curved inwards, not torulose, (3–)5–13 cm × 2.2–5 mm, terete when immature, becoming strongly latiseptate, not striped; valves with obscure midvein, pubescent outside, trichomes 2–5-rayed, glabrous inside; ovules 42–68 per ovary; style cylindrical or flattened, stout, 0.5–2.5 mm, sparsely pubescent; stigma 2-lobed, lobes as long as wide. Seeds broadly ovate to suborbicular, (1.5–)2–4 × 1.5–3 mm; wing continuous. 2n = 36.</description><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><habitat>coastal bluffs</habitat><habitat>dunes</habitat><habitat>prairies</habitat><elevation>0–400 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Oreg.</us_distribution><discussion>Erysimum concinnum is a coastal species known from Curry County in Oregon, and from Del Norte, Humboldt, Marin, Mendocino, and Sonoma counties in California. Both G. B. Rossbach (1958) and R. C. Rollins (1993) treated it as a distinct species, but R. A. Price (1993) reduced it (invalidly) to a subspecies of E. menziesii.</discussion></treatment>
