  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Plants densely cespitose; rhizomes stout. Culms up to 12 cm, scabrous. Leaf blades V-shaped in cross section when young, (0.5–) 1.2–2 mm wide, papillose, scabrous. Inflorescences: proximal bracts usually with sheath 2.5–3 mm; lateral spikes usually 1–2 distal, 2–3 basal, 3–7 × 4 mm; terminal spike staminate or gynecandrous, 7–8 × 1.5–2 mm. Pistillate scales 3–5(–10)-veined, obovate, 3.5–4.2 × 1.3–2 mm, proximal ones longer than perigynia, apex subobtuse to acuminate and often mucronate. Staminate scales 5-veined or more, 4–5 × 1.5–2.1 mm. Perigynia 15–27-veined, most veins on faces 0.1 mm wide or wider, about as wide as marginal veins, obovoid, 3–4 × (1.1–)1.4–1.9(–2.1) mm, glabrous proximally, hispidulous distally; beak distinct, abruptly bent, 0.1–0.5 mm. Achenes sessile, with 2 faces convex, 2–2.4 × (1.1–)1.4–1.9 mm, apex retuse.</description><phenology_fruiting>late spring</phenology_fruiting><habitat>dry to dry-mesic mixed woodlands</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>700–1800 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution>N.Mex.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Tex.</us_distribution><discussion>Carex lativena was previously included in C. planostachys.
