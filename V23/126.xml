    <description>Plants perennial, stoloniferous, with some culms arching or decumbent and rooting
        at tips. Rhizomes caudexlike, concealed by crowded culms, ascending or partly horizontal,
        very short, 3 mm thick, internodes crowded. Culms compressed, 0.3–2 mm thick. Leaves: distal
        leaf sheaths persistent, papery, apex obtuse to subacute, tooth absent. Spikelets terete,
        basal spikelets absent; floral scales spiraled, membranous to cartilaginous; styles 3-fid,
        or 3-fid and 2-fid. Achenes medium to dark brown, beak paler, plano-convex to trigonous or
        biconvex, usually distally narrowed into a distinct beak, rugulose at 10X or smooth or
        finely reticulate at 10–30X. Tubercles usually obscure or absent, often merging with achene
        apex in color, texture, and form.</description>
