  <description>Plants densely cespitose or forming loose colonies, short-rhizomatous; shoots both
    vegetative and flowering. Culms usually maroon, or less often brown, tan, or pale green at base.
    Leaves: basal sheaths usually bladeless, sometimes fibrous; sheath fronts white-hyaline to
    brown-hyaline, rarely membranous; blades M-shaped in cross section when young, adaxial side with
    2 lateral veins more prominent than midvein; widest leaves not more than 13 mm, glabrous or
    pubescent, not septate-nodulose. Inflorescences racemose, with 3–7(–16 in C. obispoensis)
    spikes; proximal nonbasal bracts leaflike, except in C. castanea, sheaths usually longer than 5
    mm, except in C. castanea, C. misera, and C. sprengelii; lateral spikes erect or nodding,
    pistillate, with no more than 50 perigynia, the distal ones androgynous, rarely the proximal 1
    gynecandrous, pedunculate, peduncle 1+ cm, prophyllate; terminal spike erect, staminate,
    gynecandrous, or rarely androgynous. Proximal pistillate scales green with broad hyaline
    margins, hyaline portions white or, more often, suffused with maroon or chestnut brown, apex
    obtuse to acuminate or awned, awn not more than 3 mm, glabrous, margins sometimes ciliate.
    Perigynia erect or ascending, veined or veinless on faces, with 2 strong marginal veins,
    sometimes stipitate, narrowly lance-ovoid to fusiform to oblong-ovoid, trigonous or
    rounded-trigonous, 2–10 mm, more than 3 times as long as wide, base tapering or rounded, apex
    tapering or abruptly contracted to beak or beakless, glabrous or pubescent; beak 0.5–3 mm, ca.
    1/2 length of body, orifice entire to bidentate, teeth to 1 mm. Stigmas 3. Achenes trigonous,
    smaller than to almost as large as bodies of perigynia; style deciduous. x =
    16–30.</description>

  <discussion>Carex sect. Hymenochlaenae has been variously circumscribed and is used here in the
    broad sense, following A. A. Reznicek (1986), although it is clear that sect. Hymenochlaenae so
    defined is not monophyletic (M. J. Waterway 1999). Groups segregated by K. K. Mackenzie
    (1931–35, parts 2–3, pp. 277–299) as sect. Gracillimae, sect. Sylvaticae, and sect. Longirostres
    are included here but sect. Capillares is treated separately. A. A. Reznicek (1986) chose Carex
    cherokeensis as the lectotype for sect. Hymenochlaenae. Among the species treated here, only C.
    obispoensis and probably C. sprengelii are clearly closely related to C. cherokeensis. All three
    species differ from the others by having multiple androgynous spikes and a tendency for multiple
    spikes at each node of the inflorescence and by lacking proximal bladeless sheaths. Species
    307–314, 316–322 form a much larger group of closely related species, which when grouped with
    sect. Porocystis are apparently monophyletic (M. J. Waterway 1999), but further study is
    required before the sectional rearrangements and nomenclatural changes can be made. Those
    species share the maroon basal bladeless sheaths, a single terminal staminate or gynecandrous
    spike, the tendency to have overwintering basal leaves, and most frequently have red crystalline
    inclusions on the sheaths, perigynia, and sometimes the pistillate and staminate scales. In many
    species, basal leaves on the vegetative culms tend to be wider, sometimes much wider than the
    cauline leaves on the flowering culms, so care must be taken to observe the basal leaves,
    especially those on the vegetative culms when assessing leaf width. Sporadic hybrids among
    species within the group are quite frequent. Carex prasina, C. sylvatica, and C. assiniboinensis
    are anomalous within the section for different reasons and have no more affinity with each other
    than with the core species. Because their placement elsewhere is also problematic they are
    retained in this treatment. Carex sect. Capillares also appears to form a distinct monophyletic
    group that is not closely related to the other species treated here.</discussion>
