  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><past_name>Rynchospora</past_name><description>Plants perennial, cespitose, 70–110 cm; rhizomes absent. Culms erect to excurved, leafy, obscurely trigonous, slender. Leaves spreading to ascending, shorter than culm, crowded toward culm base; blades linear, proximally flat, 1–3 mm wide, gradually involute, apically trigonous, subulate. Inflorescences: spikelet clusters 1–4, dense to open, mostly irregularly turbinate; peduncles ascending, branches spreading to erect, ultimate branches with many spikelets; leafy bracts setaceoustipped, usually exceeding all clusters, or at least all but the distal. Spikelets light redbrown or brown, broadly ellipsoid to lanceoloid, 3–4 mm, apex acute to acuminate; fertile scales ovate to obovate or suborbiculate, 2–3.5 mm apex acute to rounded or emarginate, midrib included or exserted as mucro. Flowers: perianth bristles mostly 6, rarely reaching fruit midbody, antrorsely barbellate. Fruits mostly 1 per spikelet, 2–2.5 mm, body dark brown, obovoid to subglobose, tumid or lenticular, 1.5–1.7 mm, transversely finely rugose to nearly level, intervals with very small, pitlike alveoli.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Varieties 2 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>midwestern</global_distribution><global_distribution>se United States.</global_distribution><key><key_statement>
