  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Plants densely cespitose, in small clumps; rhizomes short. Culms often arching, weak, 10–40(–60) cm. Leaves: sheaths pale to mid brown abaxially, inner band thin and hyaline, concave at summit; ligules as wide as long, 2–8 mm; blades usually gray-green, flat to channeled, 5–15 cm × 1–2 mm, usually shorter than culms. Inflorescences erect, 1–2 cm × 5–12 mm; proximal bracts usually scalelike, shorter than spikes. Spikes 2–4, closely approximate, individually distinct, proximal lateral spikes pistillate, containing 5–10(–15) perigynia, oblong-linear; terminal spike gynecandrous, containing 10(–20) perigynia, clavate. Pistillate scales pale to red-brown with yellow-brown center and white-hyaline margins, oblong-ovate, subequal to perigynia, apex obtuse. Perigynia ascending, light to pale brown, often gray-brown at maturity, lightly or obscurely several-veined, from broadly elliptic-obovate to lanceolate, 1.5–3.5 × 1.–1.5 mm, widest near middle, subcoriaceous; beak short, entire. Achenes mid brown to red-brown, elliptic, 1.5 × 1–1.25 mm, dull to slightly glossy. 2n = 66.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Subspecies 3 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>North America</global_distribution><global_distribution>Eurasia.</global_distribution><key><key_statement>
