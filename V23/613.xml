Culms (24–)35–85 cm. Leaves: sheath adaxially white-hyaline, summits U-shaped to rounded; distal ligules 2–3 mm; blades (1–)2–4(–5) per fertile culm, flat ± to tip, 7–22 cm × (1.5–)2–3.5(–4) mm. Inflorescences stiffly erect, usually open, brown, 1.5–4 cm × 10–15 mm; proximal internode (2.5–)4–10 mm; 2d internode (2.5–)3–6 mm; proximal bracts scalelike or bristlelike, shorter than inflorescences. Spikes 5–9, usually loosely aggregated, ovoid to broadly ovoid, 9–14 × 6–8 mm, base attenuate, apex rounded to tapered. Pistillate scales reddish gold to brown or greenish, often white-hyaline at tip or base, with pale or green midstripe, narrowly to broadly ovate, 3.4–5 mm, length and width less or greater than perigynia, margin not white-hyaline, apex acute to acuminate. Perigynia ascending to ascending-spreading, gold to light brown, conspicuously 3–9-veined abaxially, conspicuously 2–5-veined adaxially, lanceolate to ovate, usually flat except over achene, 3.4–4.7(–5.2) × 1.3–2.1 mm, 0.4–0.5 mm thick, margin flat, including wing 0.2–0.6 mm wide; beak red-brown or gold at tip, usually cylindric, unwinged, ± entire for 0.3–0.5 mm, sometimes flat, ciliate-serrulate to tip, abaxial suture often with conspicuous white margin, distance from beak tip to achene (1.2–)1.5–2 mm. Achenes elliptic to broadly ovate, 1.1–1.8 × 0.9–1.2 mm, 0.4–0.5 mm thick. 2n = 62, 64, 66, 68.</description><phenology_fruiting>summer</phenology_fruiting><phenology_fruiting>jun</phenology_fruiting><phenology_fruiting>jul</phenology_fruiting><phenology_fruiting>aug</phenology_fruiting><habitat>meadows</habitat><habitat>seasonally wet soils</habitat><elevation>0–1100 m;</elevation><global_distribution>St. Pierre and Miquelon</global_distribution><ca_distribution>B.C.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution>N.B.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution>Nfld. and Labr.
