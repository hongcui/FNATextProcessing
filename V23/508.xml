Leaves: sheaths tight, green, fronts hyaline; ligules to 2.5 mm, as long as wide; widest leaf blades 2.2–4.6 mm wide, papillose adaxially. Inflorescences with 5–14 spikes, 1.4–2.8 cm × 9–14.5 mm; proximal bracts 0.7–6(–10) cm, shorter than to 2.5(–5) times as long as inflorescences; spikes with (2–)4–24 ascending to spreading perigynia; proximal internodes shorter than proximal spikes. Pistillate scales pale brown to greenish hyaline, with green usually 1-veined center, ovate, 1.6–3.1 × 1.4–2.2 mm, body narrower than and 2/3 length of perigynium, apex usually awned, awn to 3.6 mm. Anthers 1.3–1.9 mm. Perigynia pale green to pale brown, veinless or weakly 1–10-veined on each face, 3.3–5.6 × 1.9–2.8 mm, margins serrulate distally, base of body somewhat spongy, thickened; beak (1–)1.4–1.8 mm, apical teeth (0.5–)1.4–1.8 mm.
