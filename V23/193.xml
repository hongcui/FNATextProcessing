  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Plants annual, cespitose, to 30 cm, base soft, not bulbous; rhizomes absent. Leaves nearly distichous, mostly spreading, to 2/3 length of culms; sheaths ciliate, sheath backs often pilose-hirsute; ligule present, complete; blades narrowly linear, 1.5–2.5 mm wide, flat or shallowly concave, margins scabrid, abaxial surface scattered-pilose, hirsute-ciliate at least proximally. Inflorescences: anthelae simple or compound, open, divaricately branched, mostly as broad as long; scapes slender, 1 mm wide, distally slightly compressed; proximalmost involucral bract exceeding or shorter than anthela. Spikelets pale brown or red-brown, ovoid to lanceoloid, 5–6 mm; fertile scales broadly ovate, 1.5–2 mm, acute- to obtuse-angled, midrib short-excurrent as mucro. Flowers: stamens 1–2; styles 2-fid, flat, fimbriate. Achenes whitened-iridescent to brown, lenticular or pyriform-obovoid, 1 mm, cancellate, each face with 5–12 vertical rows of transversely oriented rectangular pits, achene margins distally papillose. 2n = 20.</description><phenology_fruiting>summer</phenology_fruiting><phenology_fruiting>jun</phenology_fruiting><phenology_fruiting>jul</phenology_fruiting><phenology_fruiting>aug</phenology_fruiting><phenology_fruiting>fall</phenology_fruiting><phenology_fruiting>sep</phenology_fruiting><phenology_fruiting>oct</phenology_fruiting><phenology_fruiting>nov</phenology_fruiting><habitat>disturbed sites</habitat><habitat>low pinelands</habitat><habitat>banks</habitat><habitat>and fields</habitat><elevation>0–100 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ala.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Fla.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Ga.</us_distribution><us_distribution>La.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Miss.</us_distribution><us_distribution>N.C.</us_distribution><us_distribution>S.C.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Tex.</us_distribution><discussion>In the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal plains, Fimbristylis decipiens often shares habitat with two close, likewise weedy, relatives: F. dichotoma and F. annua. From the former F. decipiens is distinguished by its annual habit, its papillose distal achene edges, and the more spreading anthela branches; from the latter it differs in its usually less papillose achene and its harder, more spreading foliage. No intergrades appear to occur among the three.</discussion></treatment>
