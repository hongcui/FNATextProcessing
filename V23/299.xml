Culms trigonous, (7–)20–70(–85) cm × (0.5–)1–1.8(–2.6) mm, glabrous or sparsely to densely scabridulous on surfaces or on angles immediately proximal to inflorescence in distal 3–6 cm. Leaves 2–3, flat to V-shaped, (12–)20–40(–55) cm × (2–)3–5(–7) mm. Inflorescences: spikes (1–)3–4(–6), largest erect, others at base of central spike, erect spike sessile, loosely to densely cylindric to ovoid-cylindric, (12–)18–30 × (6–)12–20 mm, remaining spikes 1/2 as large; rays absent; bracts (2–)3–6(–10), ± horizontal to reflexed parallel to culm, (2–)6–16(–25) cm × (1.5–)2–4(–7) mm; rachilla ± deciduous, wingless. Spikelets (8–)15–30, spreading to ascending-appressed, oblong-lanceoloid, quadrangular, slightly compressed, 5–8(–10) × (2–)2.4–3.4(–4.2) mm; floral scales (2–)4–6(–8), yellowish, reddish, or greenish brown, medially greenish, straight to excurved, laterally (2–)3–4(–5)-ribbed, medially (1–)3–(–5)-ribbed, ovate-orbiculate, 2.4–2.8(–3.4) × 2.4–2.8(–3.4) mm, apex obtuse, mucronate to cuspidate, stout, (0.1–)0.3–0.6 mm, medially glabrous. Flowers: anthers 0.4–0.8 mm; styles 0.7–1.3 mm; stigmas 0.7–1.2 mm. Achenes finely reticulate, brown to reddish brown, ± stipelike, obovoid, 1.6–1.9 × 1.1–1.4(–1.6) mm, base attenuate to cuneate, 0.1–0.2 × 0.2 mm, apex obtuse, apiculate, surfaces glabrous.</description><phenology_fruiting>summer</phenology_fruiting><phenology_fruiting>jun</phenology_fruiting><phenology_fruiting>jul</phenology_fruiting><phenology_fruiting>aug</phenology_fruiting><habitat>clearings in montane forests</habitat><elevation>500–1800 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Colo.</us_distribution><us_distribution>N.Mex.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Tex.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Wyo.</us_distribution><global_distribution>Mexico.</global_distribution><discussion>Hybridization between Cyperus fendlerianus and C. sphaerolepis occurs occasionally in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico (B.
