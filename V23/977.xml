  <discussion>Carex diluta was discovered in Montana in 1995; it occurs there in relatively natural saline habitats. Its similarity to some Eurasian members of the C. diluta complex suggests that it is probably an introduction.</discussion>
  <discussion>The taxonomy of Carex diluta and closely related taxa varies throughout Eurasia. A. O. Chater (1980) and T. V. Egorova (1999) applied a broad species concept, which is followed here. However, V. I. Kreczetowicz (1935) recognized four taxa in the complex: C. diluta (in the strict sense), C. karelinii Meinshausen, C. aspratilis V. I. Kreczetowicz, and C. czarwakensis Litvinov. Montana populations appear to correspond most closely to C. karelinii. Further comparisons of the Montana plants with Eurasian material are needed, and indeed, a further examination of this complex throughout its native range in Eurasia is warranted.</discussion>
