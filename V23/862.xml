  <discussion>Hybrids between Carex castanea and C. arcata (= C. ×knieskernii) occur quite frequently across the overlapping ranges of the parental species, in roadside ditches near cedar swamps and disturbed areas in deciduous forests, where the two parental species can often be found in close proximity. Carex castanea also hybridizes rarely with C. debilis var. rudgei and probably also with C. gracillima, although the latter hybrid has not been confirmed. The length of the proximal inflorescence bract and its sheath are strongly dependent on location on the culm: If the proximal spike is positioned low on the culm, the blade is leaflike with an obvious but short sheath; if positioned more distally, the blade is reduced to an auriculate awn without a sheath. The chromosome number (2n = 64) reported by Á. Löve &amp; D. Löve (1981b) is probably erroneous.</discussion>
