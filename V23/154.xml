  <discussion>Eleocharis diandra is close to E. ovata and E. aestuum; it probably should be treated as a distinct species (A. Haines 2001). It is apparently adapted to the greatly fluctuating water levels of rivers and large lakes (e.g., Oneida Lake in New York, Lake Champlain in Vermont). I have not seen specimens of E. diandra from Maine, New Jersey, or Pennsylvania, which may be based on specimens of E. aestuum. Specimens from the Lake-of-the-Woods shore in southwest Ontario are like E. diandra; they have floral scales with apices rounded, not acute as in typical E. diandra. The only recent observations of E. diandra are from the Connecticut River in Massachusetts (1985) and Oneida Lake in New York (1968; A. Haines 2001).</discussion>
