Leaves: sheaths sometimes abaxially green and white mottled near to collar, adaxially green-veined near collar, Y-shaped, white-hyaline area at collar, adaxially firm, summits U-shaped; distal ligules 2–5.5 mm; blades on fertile culms 3–5, 1.5–24 cm × 1.8–4 mm. Inflorescences open or dense, usually nodding or arching, yellowish brown, 2.3–8.4 cm × 6–17 mm; proximal internode 2.3–16 mm; 2d internode 6–15 mm; proximal bracts bristlelike to 3 cm. Spikes (3–)5–8(–9), distant, distinct, conic to globose, 8–19 × 4.2–8.2 mm, base often strongly clavate, apex acute to rounded; staminate portion of well-developed spikes to 11 mm. Pistillate scales yellowish brown to reddish brown with green midstripe, lanceolate or narrowly ovate, 3–4 mm, shorter and narrower than perigynia, margins white-hyaline, apex acute to obtuse. Perigynia appressed, pale yellow or golden brown with green wing and beak, conspicuously 4–6-veined abaxially, conspicuously 4–6(–7)-veined adaxially, obovate to broadly elliptic, biconvex, 3–4.7 × 1.9–2.8 mm, 0.4–0.5 mm thick, margin flat, including wing 0.5–0.9 mm wide; beak greenish at tip, flat, ciliate-serrulate, abaxial suture with white or reddish brown-hyaline margin, distance from beak tip to achene 1.8–2.7 mm. Achenes elliptic, 1.4–2 × 0.9–1.2 mm, 0.4–0.5 mm thick, 48b apiculum 0.4–0.8 mm; style straight or slightly sinuous. 2n = 62.</description><phenology_fruiting>early summer</phenology_fruiting><habitat>seepy stream banks</habitat><habitat>permanently wet ditches</habitat><habitat>pond shores</habitat><habitat>wet depressions in meadows and pastures</habitat><elevation>100–400 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ark.</us_distribution><us_distribution>La.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Okla.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Tex.</us_distribution><discussion>See note under 146.
