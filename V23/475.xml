  <description type="morphology">Culms (1–)2–90 cm. Leaves: sheaths adaxially whitish, conspicuously red dotted,
        truncate or convex at mouth, prolonged 0.4–4(–6) mm beyond base of blade; ligules 8–57 mm;
        foliage leaf blades 14–30(–47) cm × 1–2.5 mm. Inflorescences bisexual, straight, little
        interrupted, ± compound (short branch at least on most proximal node or, occasionally,
        unbranched) , 2–5(–6) × 0.6–1.4(–1.7) cm, proximal 0–3 branches slightly overlapping 1
        above; basal branch (when present) with 2–12 spikes; proximal internode 3–7(–10) mm.
        Pistillate scales straw colored or brownish, 1.5–2.7 × 0.9–1.6 mm, as wide as perigynia at
        base, narrower distally. Perigynia ± spreading, olive to dark chestnut brown, stongly
        4–6-veined and finely 2–4-veined abaxially, with narrow median strip extending full length
        (grooved aspect emphasized by pair of bordering veins), often membranous flap toward apex,
        narrowly deltoid-ovoid, unequally biconvex, (2–)2.3–2.5(–2.9) × 1–1.4 mm, shiny; beak
        0.9–1.1 mm. Achenes broadly compressed-ovoid, 1.4–1.7 × 0.7–1 mm. 2n = 48, 50, 54,
        60.</description>

  <other_name type="common_name">Carex diandre</other_name>
  <discussion>Although common northward (but not at the highest latitudes except in District of
        Mackenzie and Yukon), this circumboreal sedge is occasional to rare throughout much of its
        United States range. Carex diandra was reported from Tennessee by J. K. Underwood (1945) and
        in lists of Tennessee plants on the basis of an old specimen that has been destroyed. H. A.
        Gleason and A. Cronquist’s (1963, 1991) report for Missouri, quoted in later floras and
        catalogues, is believed to be erroneous. See comments under C. prairea.</discussion>
