  <discussion>Confined to the interior of eastern North America, Carex shortiana is common west of the Allegheny Mountains, especially throughout the Ohio River Valley. It is notable among tristigmatic carices in having all the spikes gynecandrous, the lateral ones conspicuously repeating the pattern of the terminal spike.</discussion>
  <discussion>Carex shortiana rarely hybridizes with either C. squarrosa or C. typhina in the Midwest and produces the sterile hybrid C. ×deamii F. J. Hermann. The spikes of the hybrid are subcylindric as in C. shortiana but thicker (7–8 mm instead of 3.5–5.6 mm), and the perigynia resemble those of C. squarrosa but with their bodies more compressed and beaks intermediate in length (1–1.5 mm). Plants of that hybrid are known from Indiana (F. J. Hermann 1938, 1940b), Missouri (J. A. Steyermark 1958, 1963; G. Yatskievych and J. Turner 1990; G. Yatskievych 1999+), Illinois (W. J. Hess and P. Shildneck 1982), and Kentucky (supporting specimens in PH). The second parent has been hypothesized to be C. typhina, but all evidence strongly suggests C. squarrosa (D. K. Evans, unpubl. data), although either may occur at stations from which C. ×deamii is known.</discussion>
