  <description>Plants cespitose, stout-rhizomatous. Culms brown [purple-] or red-brown at base,
    sharply angled or winged. Leaves: basal sheaths not fibrous; sheath fronts membranous,
    pubescent; blades M-shaped in cross section when young, adaxial side of blade with 2, lateral,
    veins more prominent than midvein, septate-nodulose, larger blades 8–23 mm wide, not hairy,
    sometimes scabrous on adaxial surface [or puberulous]. Inflorescences racemose, with 4–8(–9)
    spikes; proximal nonbasal bracts leaflike, sheathless or sheath less than 4 mm, pubescent;
    lateral spikes pistillate, pedunculate, prophyllate; terminal spike staminate (rarely
    gynecandrous). Proximal pistillate scales with apex acute or awned. Perigynia ascending or
    spreading, veined or veinless, with 2, strong, marginal veins, slightly stipitate, [ovate to
    lance- or oblong-ovate] obovate, rounded-trigonous in cross section, less than 10 mm, base
    tapering or rounded, apex abruptly contracted to beak, glabrous or scabrous; beak conic,
    recurved, 0.7–1.9 mm, orifice hyaline, erose or bidentate, teeth less than 0.8 mm. Stigmas 3.
    Achenes trigonous, almost as large as bodies of perigynia; style deciduous.</description>
