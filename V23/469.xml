  <discussion>Carex nervina and C. neurophora share distinctive proximal sheaths, which are elongate (to 15 cm) and longer than their blades, do not split with age, truncate at the apex, prominently veined, and green. These taxa may be distinguished by vegetative characters of the distal leaf sheaths, which are smooth with a hyaline convex apex in C. neurophora and rugose with a cartilaginous concave apex in C. nervina. Perigynia characters also distinguish the taxa; C. nervina has a greater number of veins and a glabrous beak. The parapatric distribution and shared sheath characteristics indicate that these species may be recently derived from a common ancestor.</discussion>
