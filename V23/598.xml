        sometimes prolonged to 2 mm beyond collar; distal ligules 2.5–8 mm; blades 3–5 per fertile
        culm; 15–45 cm × 2–3(–4) mm. Inflorescences ascending, dense, green to gold or brown,
        (1–)1.4–2.5 cm × 9–17 mm; proximal internode 1.5–4 mm; 2d internode 1–4 mm; proximal 2–3
        bracts erect to ascending, leaflike, the proximal longer than inflorescence, often more than
        2 mm wide, base ± surrounding culm. Spikes 5–11, ± individually indistinct, ovoid to broadly
        ovoid, 7–13 × 5–9 mm, base rounded to acute, apex truncate to acute. Pistillate scales pale
        gold to red-brown, with pale to green midstripe, lanceolate to ovate, 3.3–4.8 mm, shorter
        and narrower than perigynia, margin sometimes white, 0.1–0.2 mm wide, apex acuminate to

        0.2–0.3 mm wide; beak usually gold or red-brown at tip, usually flat, winged, ±
        ciliate-serrulate or, sometimes, cylindric, unwinged, ± entire for 0.5–0.6 mm, (1.4–)1.7–2.5
        mm, abaxial suture inconspicuous or with white margin, distance from beak tip to achene.
        Achenes stipitate, ovate to obovate, (1.2–)1.5–1.9 × 0.75–1(–1.2) mm, 0.3–0.4 mm
