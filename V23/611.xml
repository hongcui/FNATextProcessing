Pistillate scales dark brown, red-brown, or red-gold, sometimes with green to gold midstripe, ovate, 3.6–4.7 mm, shorter than and narrower or as wide as perigynia, margin gold-hyaline, to 0.3 mm wide, apex acuminate or acute. Perigynia appressed to ascending, green, gold, or brown, conspicuously usually 7–9-veined abaxially, conspicuously 0–5-veined adaxially, veins shorter than achene, lanceolate to ovate, plano-convex, to 5.3–7.1 × 1.1–1.5 mm, 0.4–0.5 mm thick, margin flat, including wing 0.15–0.3 mm wide, ciliate-serrulate at least on distal body; beak dark brown, sometimes gold-hyaline at tip, cylindric, unwinged, ± entire for 0.9–1.5 mm, dorsal suture inconspicuous or with conspicuous white margin, distance from beak tip to achene 2.9–4 mm.
