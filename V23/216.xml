  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><etymology>[for Peder Chritian Abildgaard, 1740–1801, Danish professor of verterinary medicine]</etymology><author>Robert Kral</author><description>Herbs, perennial, cespitose, rhizomatous or not. Culms round. Leaves basal, polystichous; sheaths distally open, loose, ribbed; ligules absent; blades mostly filiform, compressed or lunate to semicircular in cross section, margins strongly involute. Inflorescences terminal, pseudoumbellate or capitate or solitary spikelet; spikelets 1–5; involucral bract 1, spreading to erect, scalelike or linear. Spikelets terminal, straw colored, ovoid to lance-ovoid, somewhat compressed laterally, whole spikelet flat or with torque; scales 10–30, all distichously arranged, each subtending flower on short pedicel-joint, proximal 1–2 empty. Flowers bisexual, protandrous; perianth absent; stamens 2–3; styles linear, base enlarged, 3-fid, deciduous in fruit. Achenes trigonous.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 15 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>pantropics and subtropics.</global_distribution><discussion>Plants of Abildgaardia are hardbased, mostly cespitose, sometimes thickrhizomatous, with wiry scapes and leaves, mostly glabrous. The spikelet as a whole is either flat or with torque; scales are keeled, the proximal one, two, or rarely three are bracteal, mostly cuspidate, the rest fertile, strongly imbricate. Flower filaments are slender, flat; anthers erect, oblong-linear, bilocular. After fertilization, the style disarticulates above the trigonous base, leaving an apiculus on the ovary. Achenes are obpyriform, stipitate, turgid, prominently threeribbed, apiculate, and warty.</discussion><discussion>Abildgaardia is of debatable limits. Some authors have placed it in Fimbristylis or with Bulbostylis; current research discloses a significantly different embryology and anatomy.</discussion><references>
