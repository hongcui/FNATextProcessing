    <description>Plants densely cespitose, in large clumps, short-rhizomatous. Culms reddish purple
        at base, 90–180 cm. Leaves: basal sheaths sometimes fibrous; sheath fronts reddish or green,
        veined, herbaceous; blades flat to M-shaped in cross section when young, adaxial side with 2
        lateral veins more prominent than midvein, widest leaves not more than 10 mm wide, glabrous.
        Inflorescences racemose, with 5–8 spikes; proximal bracts leaflike, long-sheathing, sheath
        4+ mm, longer than diameter of stem; lateral spikes pistillate, with at least 100 perigynia
        in each, (30–)60+ mm or some spikes androgynous, pendent, pedunculate, prophyllate; terminal
        spikes usually staminate. Proximal pistillate scales with apex acute to acuminate or
        short-awned. Perigynia ascending, weakly veined on faces, with 2, strong, marginal veins,
        sessile, elliptic or ovate, obtusely and asymmetrically trigonous in cross section, base
        tapering, apex abruptly beaked, glabrous; beak 0.5 mm or less, erose-ciliate, bidentate,
        teeth less than 0.1 mm. Stigmas 3. Achenes trigonous, smaller than bodies of perigynia;
