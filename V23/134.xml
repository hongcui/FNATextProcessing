  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Plants usually annual, tufted, sometimes mat-forming via proliferating and arching inflorescences (stoloniferous), sometimes entirely vegetative; rhizomes absent. Culms often ascending or arching, quadrangular or broadly elliptic, 2–40 cm × 0.1–0.4(–0.6) mm, soft. Leaves: distal leaf sheaths persistent or disintegrating, pale brown, green or red-brown, streaked or mottled red-brown or purple, translucent, membranous, apex narrowly acute. Spikelets: basal spikelets absent; often proliferous, ovoid to ellipsoid or lanceoloid, terete, 2–10.7 × 1–2 mm, apex acute; proximal scale empty, persistent, amplexicaulous, dissimilar to floral scales, often longer, often resembling an involucral bract, ovate to lanceolate, midrib markedly thickened and broad and often prolonged beyond lamina; subproximal scale with flower; floral scales spiraled, colorless, whitish, or pale brown, streaked or mottled red-brown or purple, midribs green and red-brown or green and purple, ovate to elliptic, 0.8–1.5 × 0.4–0.8 mm, membranous, midrib obscure to prominent. Flowers: perianth bristles present or sometimes apparently absent; stamens 3; anthers 0.15–0.35; styles 3-fid. Achenes whitish to olive or pale brown, sometimes spotted olive or red-brown, obovoid, trigonous (or subterete), angles prominent, 0.55–0.8 × 0.3–0.5 mm, apex constricted proximal to tubercle, smooth. Tubercles green or pale brown to red-brown, trigonous.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Varieties 2 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>North America</global_distribution><global_distribution>West Indies.</global_distribution><discussion>Specimens of Eleocharis brittonii and E. microcarpa without achenes are often difficult to distinguish.
