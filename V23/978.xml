  <description>Plants cespitose or not, short-rhizomatous. Culms brown at base. Leaves: basal
    sheaths not fibrous; sheath fronts membranous; blades sparsely septate-nodulose, usually
    V-shaped in cross section when young, glabrous. Inflorescences racemose, with 2–6 spikes;
    proximal nonbasal bracts leaflike, long-sheathing, shorter or longer than diameter of stem;
    lateral spikes pistillate, rarely distal androgynous, larger spikes with not more than 40
    perigynia, dense, pedunculate, prophyllate; terminal spike staminate or, occasionally,
    androgynous. Proximal pistillate scales with apex obtuse, acute, or cuspidate. Perigynia
    ascending, spreading, or reflexed, proximal and middle perigyinia separated by internodes less
    than 1/10 their length, yellow-brown to brown, strongly veined on faces, slightly stipitate,
    obovoid or, rarely, narrowly ovoid, rounded-trigonous, less than 10 mm, base tapering to
    rounded, apex abruptly contracted or, rarely, tapering to beak, glabrous; beak bidentate, teeth
    less than 0.5 mm. Stigmas 3. Achenes trigonous, 1–2 mm, smaller than bodies of perigynia; style
    deciduous.</description>

  <discussion>Sterile hybrids regularly form among species of Carex sect. Ceratocystis. These
    include Carex hostiana × C. flava (= C. ×xanthocarpa Dégland), C. hostiana × C. viridula (= C.
    ×fulva Goodenough), C. flava × C. viridula (= C. ×ruedtii Kneucker), and C. cryptolepis × C.
    viridula.</discussion>
  <discussion>Some taxa included within C. viridula have been treated as species. Hybrids that form
    among these taxa (subspecies and varieties) are partially fertile, indicating that they have not
    diverged widely enough to be reproductively isolated. Their morphologic variation patterns also
    overlap (W. J. Crins and P. W. Ball 1989).</discussion>
  <discussion>Carex sect. Ceratocystis is most closely related to sect. Spirostachyae (Drejer) L. H.
    Bailey, an Old World group with three introduced species in North America. These sections often
    have been combined as sect. Extensae Fries (a later name), but several characteristics
    distinguish the sections (W. J. Crins and P. W. Ball 1988).</discussion>
  <discussion>In the keys that follow, curvature of the perigynium beak is measured as the angle
    formed by the junction of a straight line through the beak with a straight line through the
    abaxial portion of the perigynium body. Perigynium length includes the body and beak, unless
    noted otherwise.</discussion>
