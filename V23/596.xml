Inflorescences dense or loosely aggregated, gold to medium brown or occasionally dark brown, 1.1–2.4 cm × 6.3–14 mm; proximal internode (1.5–)2.5–9.5 mm; 2d internode 1–3 mm; proximal bracts bristlelike.

Pistillate scales gold to dark brown, with whitish to green midstripe, ovate, 1.9–3.5 mm, shorter or slightly longer than perigynia and ± equal in width, margin white, 0–0.2(–0.4) mm wide, apex obtuse to acute. Perigynia ascending to ascending-spreading, straw colored to light brown with green distal margins, conspicuously 0–5-veined abaxially, conspicuously 0–4-veined adaxially, at most 1 vein reaching top of achene, lance-ovate to ovate, plano-convex or flat, usually constricted near base when dry, 2.1–3.6 × 0.8–1.4 mm, 0.4–0.5 mm thick, margin flat, 0.05–0.15(–0.2) mm wide, entire, not usually extending to distal body and beak; beak gold to dark brown at tip, cylindric, unwinged, abaxial suture conspicuously white-margined, or occasionally inconspicuous, distance from beak tip to achene 1–1.6 mm, entire for at least 0.4 mm.
