    <description>Shrubs, spreading to compact, to 10 m. Bark smooth; lenticels scattered,
        conspicuous to inconspicuous, small, mostly unenlarged. Winter buds nearly sessile, ovoid,
        apex acuminate; stalks usually not over 1 mm; scales 4--6, unequal, imbricate. Leaf blade
        broadly to narrowly ovate or elliptic, 3--11 × 3--8 cm, base rounded, obtuse, or cuneate,
        sometimes nearly cordate, margins serrulate to coarsely doubly serrate, apex acute to
        rounded; surfaces abaxially glabrous to tomentose, lightly to heavily resin-coated.
        Inflorescences: staminate catkins in 1 cluster of 2--4, formed late in growing season before
        flowering and exposed during winter; pistillate catkins in 1 or more clusters of 2--10,
        formed season before blooming, enclosed in buds during winter, exposed with new growth in
        spring. Flowering with new growth in spring. Infructescences ovoid to ellipsoid or nearly
        cylindric; peduncles relatively long, thin. Samaras elliptic to obovate, wings wider than
        body, membranaceous.</description>

    <discussion>Alnus viridis is distinctive among the alders in its essentially sessile buds with
        several imbricate scales and in its relatively long, thin, infructescence peduncles. Like
        the birches, only the staminate catkins are exposed during the winter prior to
        blooming.</discussion>
