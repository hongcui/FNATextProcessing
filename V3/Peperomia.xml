  <discussion>Many species of Peperomia are used as houseplants, greenhouse plants, and, in warm regions, garden plants.</discussion>
  <discussion>In addition to the species below, Peperomia simplex Hamilton has been attributed to southern Florida, but no verifying specimens have been seen. A single specimen of Peperomia emarginella (Swartz ex Wikström) C. de Candolle is in the herbarium of the New York Botanical Garden. The specimen may be from southeastern United States.</discussion>
