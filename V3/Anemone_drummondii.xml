Basal leaves 5-15, 2-ternate, occasionally irregularly so; petiole 2-10 cm; terminal leaflet sessile or basally attenuate and appearing petiolulate, obovate to obtriangular, 0.5-3 × 0.5-2 cm, base narrowly cuneate to cuneate, margins incised to dissected on distal 1/3-1/2, apex broadly acute to obtuse, surfaces villous; lateral leaflets 2×-parted, division frequently irregular; ultimate segments 1-2.6 mm wide. Inflorescences 1(-2)-flowered; peduncle villous; involucral bracts 3(-4), 1-tiered, ±similar to basal leaves, highly reduced, 2-ternate or irregularly so, bases distinct; terminal leaflet sessile or basally attenuate and appearing petiolulate, obovate to pinnatifid, 1-3.5 × 0.5-2 cm, bases narrowly cuneate to cuneate, margins incised to dissected on distal 1/3-1/2, apex broadly acute to obtuse, surfaces villous; lateral leaflets 2×-parted, division frequently irregular; ultimate segments 1-2.5 mm wide. Flowers: sepals (5-)6-9, white, or abaxially white, tinged blue, and adaxially white, ovate, rarely oblong or narrowly obovate, 8-20 × 6-10 mm, abaxially hairy, rarely glabrous, adaxially glabrous; stamens 80-100, whitish; styles white. Heads of achenes spheric, rarely cylindric; pedicel (2-)3-10 cm. Achenes: body ovoid, 2-4 × 1-1.5 mm, not winged, woolly; beak straight, 2-4(-6) mm, glabrous.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Varieties 2 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Asia.</global_distribution><discussion>Anemone drummondii is an extremely variable species whose circumscription is controversial. Some plants appear intermediate between this species and A. multifida; cytologically the two are quite distinct (G.Boraiah and M.Heimburger 1964; C. L. Hitchcock et al. 1955-1969, vol.2).</discussion></treatment>
