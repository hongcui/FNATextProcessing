    <discussion>Argemone mexicana is probably native to southern Florida as well as the Caribbean
        islands and has been introduced along the coast of the United States from New England to
        Texas and, more infrequently, inland. Although it has been reported from Mississippi, no
        specimens are known. It is widespread in temperate and tropical regions around the world by
        introduction.</discussion>
