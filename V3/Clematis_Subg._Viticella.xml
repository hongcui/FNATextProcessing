  <discussion>Species 6 (1 in the flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>Clematis subg. Viticella has sometimes been included in Clematis subg. Viorna, as suggested by F. B. Essig (1992), although it is very different from subg. Viorna in the strict sense in the aspect of its flowers and was treated as a distinct genus by earlier authors.</discussion>
  <discussion>Several other large-flowered European and Asiatic species and hybrids, including Clematis campaniflora Brotero, with broadly campanulate perianth, and C. florida Thunberg, C. lanuginosa Lindley, and C. ×jackmanii T. Moore (= C. lanuginosa × C. viticella), with rotate perianth often with 6-8 sepals, occasionally persist after cultivation; in some cases they have become very locally naturalized.</discussion>
