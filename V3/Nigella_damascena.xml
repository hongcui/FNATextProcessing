Leaves 2-16 cm; basal leaves petiolate, segments wider than ±sessile cauline leaves. Inflorescences: involucral bracts whorled, similar to cauline leaves, curving up to surround flower. Flowers 10-50(-60) mm diam.; sepals blue, sometimes pink or white, short-clawed, 8-25 × 3-15 mm, apex entire to irregularly incised or lobed, occasionally lacerate; petals clawed, abaxial lip distally 2-lobed, bearing 2-3 nectar glands or apex expanded, adaxial lip scalelike. Capsules smooth, 8-35 mm; locules 5-10; beak persistent, slender.</description><phenology>Flowering late spring-early fall</phenology><habitat> Dump sites and waste places</habitat><elevation> 0-400 m</elevation><introduced> introduced</introduced><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Ont.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Que.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Ill.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Kans.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Md.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Mich.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Mo.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.Y.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Ohio</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Pa.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Tenn.</us_distribution><us_distribution> W.Va.</us_distribution><global_distribution> native to Eurasia.</global_distribution><discussion>Nigella damascena is frequently cultivated as an ornamental and for dried-flower arrangements. It occasionally escapes cultivation and may become established. Populations in Ontario and Quebec, and probably elsewhere, are short-lived.</discussion><discussion>Most North American populations of Nigella damascena are represented by a mixture of single- and double-flowered (having supernumerary flower parts) individuals. Sepals tend to be larger and more variable in color than in Eurasian plants. Single-flowered plants usually have petals; petals appear to be absent in double-flowered individuals.</discussion></treatment>
