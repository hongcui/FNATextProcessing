Leaves mostly on proximal 1/3 of stem; basal leaves (0-)2-7 at anthesis; cauline leaves 3-6 at anthesis; petiole 0.3-8 cm. Leaf blade round, 1-4 × 1.5-7 cm, glabrous to puberulent; ultimate lobes 3-19, width 1-8 mm (basal), 1-3 mm (cauline). Inflorescences 3-12(-22)-flowered; pedicel 1-4(-8) cm, ± puberulent; bracteoles 2-7(-17) mm from flowers, green, sometimes white-margined, lanceolate, 4-6(-8) mm, puberulent. Flowers: sepals dark blue, puberulent, lateral sepals usually spreading, 16-21 × 6-12 mm, spurs straight to gently decurved, ascending 0-40° above horizontal, 13-23 mm; lower petal blades covering stamens, 7-12 mm, clefts 0.1-3 mm; hairs sparse, short, mostly on inner lobes below junction of blade and claw, white or yellow. Fruits (12-)16-22 mm, 4-4.5 times longer than wide, usually puberulent. Seeds often winged; seed coat cells with surfaces ± smooth.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Subspecies 2 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> w North America.</global_distribution><discussion>Delphinium bicolor is closely related to D. glareosum; it differs in its wider-lobed cauline leaves, shallower petal clefts, and narrower fruits.</discussion><discussion>The Gosiute consider this plant to be poisonous (D.
