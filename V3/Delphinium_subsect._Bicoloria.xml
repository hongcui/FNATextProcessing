Stems 1(-2) per root, usually unbranched, elongation delayed 2-6(-10) weeks after leaf initiation; base ± narrowed, ± tenuously attached to root; proximal internodes much shorter than those of midstem. Leaves basal and cauline, largest leaves near base of stem, others often abruptly smaller on distal portion of stem; basal petioles spreading, cauline petioles ascending; blade shape and lobing similar throughout. Inflorescences usually with 2-6 flowers per 5 cm, open, ± pyramidal, seldom more than 3 times longer than wide, spurs rarely intersecting rachis; pedicel spreading, usually more than 1.5 cm, rachis to midpedicel angle more than 30°; bracts markedly smaller and fewer lobed than leaves. Fruits spreading. Seeds obpyramidal, 1.6-2.9 × 0.7-1.9 mm, ± ringed at proximal end, usually wing-margined; seed coats lacking wavy ridges, cells elongate, cell margins straight.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 6 (6 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> w North America.</global_distribution></treatment>
