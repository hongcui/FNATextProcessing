  <discussion>Quercus garryana var. semota is common on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada and north slope of the Tehachapi Mountains. Its northern limit appears to be on dry volcanics in southern Oregon. The fruit of this variety is often rather large, falling in the range of that seen in Q. garryana var. garryana. Some material with elongate-oblong acorns suggests introgression from Q. lobata may occur in isolated localities at the lower reaches of Q. garryana var. semota and higher limits of Q. lobata.</discussion>
