Stems 1(-4) per root, usually unbranched, elongation delayed 2-10 weeks after leaf initiation; base usually not narrowed, firmly attached to root; proximal internodes much shorter than those of midstem. Leaves basal and cauline, largest near base of stem, others usually abruptly smaller on distal portion of stem; basal petioles spreading, cauline petioles ascending; basal leaves more rounded and with fewer, wider lobes than cauline leaves. Inflorescences usually 2-9 flowers per 5 cm, open to dense, cylindric-narrow-pyramidal, spurs rarely intersecting rachis; pedicel spreading to ascending, often more than 2 cm, rachis to midpedicel angle more than 30°; bracts usually smaller and fewer lobed than leaves. Fruits erect. Seeds rectangular to crescent-shaped, 2-3.5 × 1.3-2.5 mm, not ringed on proximal end, wing-margined or not; seed coats ± covered with small irregular wavy ridges, cells short (less than 3 times longer than wide), cell margins usually straight.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 12 (5 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico.</global_distribution></treatment>
