Stems erect, not bulbous-based, without bulbils. Roots basal, sometimes tuberous. Leaves basal and cauline, simple or compound; basal leaves petiolate, blades variously divided, unlobed to deeply parted, compound, or filiform-dissected, segments undivided or again lobed or parted, margins entire or crenate, never serrate; cauline leaves sessile to nearly sessile or sometimes with much shorter petioles than basal leaves, blades lobed to compound or dissected (rarely unlobed in R. macauleyi and R. glaberrimus). Inflorescences 1-50-flowered cymes. Flowers pedicellate; sepals deciduous soon after anthesis, 5; petals yellow (rarely absent in R. pedatifidus); nectary scale joined with petal on 3 sides, forming pocket enclosing nectary (sometimes with apex free, forming flap shorter than pocket), glabrous or setose, free margin entire or fringed; style present. Fruits achenes, 1-locular; achene body thick-lenticular or asymmetrically thick-lenticular to compressed-globose, 1.2-2 times as wide as thick, not prolonged beyond seed; wall thick, smooth; margin low narrow ridge, often inconspicuous; beak much shorter than achene body.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species ca. 70 (22 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> worldwide except lowland tropics.</global_distribution></treatment>
