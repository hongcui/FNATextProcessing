Stems simple or rarely branching. Leaves to 35 cm. Inflorescences: peduncle moderately to densely appressed pale hispid; bracts sometimes 1-4 just beneath flower. Flowers: petals light orange to orange-red, usually with pale basal spot, sometimes dark-spotted or unspotted, to 6 cm; anthers violet; stigmas (8-)11-15, disc flat or shallowly convex. Capsules sessile, subglobose, obscurely ribbed, to 2.5 cm, glaucous.</description><phenology>Flowering spring-summer</phenology><habitat> Fields, clearings, roadsides, and disturbed sites</habitat><introduced> introduced</introduced><ca_distribution> Ont.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Colo.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Iowa</us_distribution><us_distribution> Mich.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.J.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Pa.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Utah</us_distribution><us_distribution> Va.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wis.</us_distribution><global_distribution> sw Asia.</global_distribution><discussion>An alpine species in its native range, Papaver orientale is widely grown for ornament and sometimes persists after spreading from cultivation. It should be expected elsewhere in the flora.</discussion><discussion>Papaver bracteatum Lindley, which some authors have included in P. orientale, is similar but more robust, with buds erect, sepals subtended by 3-5 sepaloid and 2 foliaceous bracts, flowers to 20 cm diam., deep red petals with dark basal spot, and capsules to 4 cm. It is widely cultivated and may occasionally escape but apparently does not become naturalized.</discussion></treatment>
