The type specimen of D. decorum var. sonomensis appears to represent a nearly direct intermediate between D. decorum and D. patens. These hybrids are quite common in the San Francisco Bay region where habitats have been disturbed. Normally a woodland plant, D. patens contrasts with D. decorum, which occurs in grassland and brushland. Delphinium decorum subsp. decorum also hybridizes with D. luteum, D. nudicaule, and D. trolliifolium.</discussion></treatment>
