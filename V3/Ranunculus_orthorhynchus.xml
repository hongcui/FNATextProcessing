    <description>Stems nearly erect or decumbent, never rooting nodally, hispid, strigose, or
        glabrous, base not bulbous. Roots sometimes fleshy and ± tuberous. Basal leaf blades
        narrowly ovate to oblong or semicircular in outline, simple to 3-5-lobed or -foliolate,
        2.8-12.5 × 2.5-14 cm, leaflets or segments undivided or 1-2×-lobed or -parted, ultimate
        segments circular to linear, margins dentate, crenate, or entire, apex rounded to narrowly
        acute. Flowers: receptacle hispid; sepals reflexed 1-2 mm above base, 5-11 × 2-4 mm, hispid,
        hirsute, or glabrous; petals 5-6, abaxially yellow or red, adaxially yellow, 8-18 × 4-11 mm.
        Heads of achenes hemispheric to ovoid, 5-13 × 6-10 mm; achenes 2.8-4.5 × 1.8-3.2 mm,
        glabrous, margin forming narrow rib 0.1-0.2 mm wide; beak persistent, narrowly lanceolate to
        subulate, straight, 1.8-3.8(-4.8) mm.</description>

    <discussion>The first two varieties (Ranunculus orthorhynchus var. orthorhynchus and R.
        orthorhynchus var. platyphyllus) are rather weak, intergrading extensively in California and
        Oregon. By contrast, R. orthorhynchus var. bloomeri often grows with the others with little
        or no intergradation (although intermediate populations are found in some areas), and it has
        been treated as a distinct species, R. bloomeri, by many taxonomists.</discussion>
