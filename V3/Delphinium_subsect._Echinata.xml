Stems 1(-2) per root, unbranched, elongation delayed 2-10 weeks after leaf initiation; base usually not narrowed, firmly attached to root; proximal internodes much shorter than those of midstem. Leaves basal and cauline, largest near base of stem, others often abruptly smaller on distal portion of stem; basal petioles spreading, cauline petioles ascending; blades of basal leaves more rounded and with fewer, wider lobes than cauline leaves. Inflorescences usually with 2-11 flowers per 5 cm, dense to open, cylindric, spurs rarely intersecting rachis; pedicel ascending, usually less than 2 cm, rachis to midpedicel angle more than 30°; bracts markedly smaller and fewer lobed than leaves. Fruits erect. Seeds ± rectangular, 1.5-2.5 × 0.8-1.5 mm, not ringed at proximal end, ± wing-margined; seed coats without wavy ridges (sometimes with prism-shaped structures in D. hansenii), cells ± brick-shaped, cell margins straight or undulate.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 4 (4 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><us_distribution> California.</us_distribution></treatment>
