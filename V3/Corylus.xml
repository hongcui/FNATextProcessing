  <discussion>Species ca. 15 (3 in the flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>Corylus differs from other Betulaceae in various features, most notably in the infructescences, which consist of small clusters of well-developed nuts, each enclosed by a loose involucre of leaflike bracts. As in Ostrya, the staminate catkins are formed during the summer and are exposed through the winter prior to anthesis. In Corylus, however, pistillate catkins develop at the same time as the staminate, and they consist of only a few flowers, protected by the scales of special buds rather than being arranged in elongate pistillate catkins. The staminate flowers are unique in the family in that well-developed sepals are occasionally present, clearly defining the three individual flowers that make up each cymule.</discussion>
  <discussion>A longstanding disparity occurs in the literature regarding the diploid chromosome number found in Corylus species, with both 2n = 22 and 2n = 28 being cited. J. G. Packer (pers. comm.) believes that the 2n = 28 for several species (R. H. Woodworth 1929c) was in error because of a misinterpretation of Woodworth's meiotic preparations, a number of which actually indicate eleven haploid chromosomes. Woodworth's count may be largely, if not entirely responsible for the persistence of this number in the literature.</discussion>
  <discussion>The genus consists of three major subgroups, the first composed of shrubby plants having a short, open involucre of two bracts surrounding the fruits (Corylus sect. Corylus). Members of Corylus sect. Tuboavellana Spach are of similar habit but have the involucre modified into a tubular beak, and Corylus sect. Acanthochlamnys Spach is characterized by densely spiny bracts. Recent treatments have avoided applying sectional names. The genus as a whole should be considered for taxonomic revision.</discussion>
  <discussion>Corylus is the source of hazelnuts and filberts. Commercial filberts (C. colurna Linnaeus and C. maxima Miller) are cultivated in various parts of the world, particularly Turkey, Italy, Spain, China, and the United States. Wild hazelnuts (C. americana and C. cornuta) are smaller but similar in flavor to those of the cultivated species.</discussion>
