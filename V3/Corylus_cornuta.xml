    <description>Shrubs or trees, open-spreading, 4--8(--15) m. Bark light to dark brown, smooth.
        Branches ascending; twigs glabrous to sparsely pubescent, sometimes with glandular hairs.
        Winter buds containing inflorescences ovoid, 3--5 × 3--4 mm, acute. Leaves: petiole glabrous
        to moderately pubescent, with or without glandular hairs. Leaf blade nearly orbiculate to
        narrowly ovate or ovate-oblong, often nearly angular and slightly lobulate near apex, 4--10
        × 3.5--12 cm, thin to leathery, base narrowly cordate to narrowly rounded, margins coarsely
        and often irregularly doubly serrate, apex obtuse to acute or acuminate; surfaces abaxially
        glabrous to moderately pubescent, usually pubescent on major veins and in vein axils.
        Inflorescences: staminate catkins lateral along branchlets on short shoots, usually in
        clusters of 2--3, 4--6 × 0.5--0.8 cm; peduncles 0.5--10 mm. Nuts in clusters of 2--6,
