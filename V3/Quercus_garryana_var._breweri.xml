Specimens sometimes placed here from the Coast Ranges of northern California are probably shrubby forms of Q. garryana var. garryana or hybrids between the latter and Q. durata (see treatment). It should be noted that key characteristics separating Q. garryana vars. breweri and semota from var. garryana (clonal habit, smaller, glabrate, brown buds, montane habitat of the former two varieties) suggest a relationship of these two varieties with the Rocky Mountain Q. gambelii. The latter species has smaller fruit than Q. garryana, but the extent of variation in this characteristic in Q. garryana var. breweri is unknown.</discussion></treatment>
