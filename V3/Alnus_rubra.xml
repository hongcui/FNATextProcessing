    <description>Trees, to 28 m; trunks often several, crowns narrow or pyramidal. Bark gray,
        smooth, darkening and breaking into shallow rectangular plates in age; lenticels
        inconspicuous. Winter buds stipitate, ellipsoid, 6--10 mm, apex rounded, long; stalks 2--8
        mm; scales 2--3, outer 2 equal and valvate, usually heavily resin-coated. Leaf blade ovate
        to elliptic, 6--16 × 3--11 cm, leathery, base broadly cuneate to rounded, margins strongly
        revolute, deeply doubly serrate or crenate, with distinctly larger secondary teeth, apex
        acute to obtuse; surfaces abaxially glabrous to sparsely pubescent. Inflorescences formed
        season before flowering and exposed during winter; staminate catkins in 1 or more clusters
        of 2--6, 3.5--14 cm; sistillate catkins in 1 or more clusters of 3--8. Flowering before new
        growth in spring. Infructescences ovoid to nearly globose, 1--3.5 × 0.6--1.5 cm; peduncles
        1--10 mm. Samaras ovate or elliptic, wings much narrower than body, irregularly elliptic to
        obovate, leathery. 2n = 28.</description>

    <discussion>Alnus rubra is the largest alder in North America north of Mexico; it often forms
        extensive stands along streams and on low-lying flood plains in the Pacific Northwest. The
        strongly revolute margins of its leaf blades make it easily distinguished from all of the
        other alders in the flora. It is an important commercial tree; the wood is used to make
        inexpensive furniture, small wooden items, and paper pulp.</discussion>
    <discussion>Native Americans used various parts of plants of Alnus rubra medicinally as a
        purgative, an emetic, for aching bones, headaches, coughs, biliousness, stomach problems,
        scrofula sores, tuberculosis, asthma, and eczema, and as a general panacea (D. E. Moerman
        1986).</discussion>
