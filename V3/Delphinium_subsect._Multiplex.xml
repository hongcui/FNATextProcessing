Stems 1-4(-8) per root, usually unbranched, rarely less than 60 cm, elongation delayed 1-3 weeks after leaf initiation; base usually not narrowed, firmly attached to root; proximal internodes much shorter than those of midstem. Leaves basal and cauline, largest near base of stem, others usually abruptly smaller on distal portion of stem; basal petioles ± spreading, cauline petioles ascending; basal leaves more rounded and with fewer, wider lobes than cauline leaves. Inflorescences usually 3-12 flowers per 5 cm, dense to open, cylindric, spurs sometimes intersecting rachis; pedicel ascending, usually less than 2 cm; if stems less than 60 cm, then pedicel remotely ascending (sigmoid); bracts usually markedly smaller and fewer lobed than leaves. Fruits erect. Seeds rectangular to crescent-shaped, 1.8-3 × 1.3-2.5 mm, not ringed at proximal end, wing-margined or not; seed coats with small irregular wavy ridges or ripples, cells elongate (more than 3 times longer than wide), cell margins straight.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 4 (4 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> w United States.</global_distribution></treatment>
