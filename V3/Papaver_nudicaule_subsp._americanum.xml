Leaves to 20 cm; petiole to 2/3 length of leaf; blade gray-green abaxially, green adaxially, lanceolate, deeply 1-2×-lobed with 3-4 pairs of primary lateral lobes, glabrate or setose adaxially with long white trichomes; primary lobes lanceolate or strap-shaped.

It includes numerous red, white, and yellow cultivars of the so-called Iceland poppy encountered along the road system in Alaska, Canada, southwestern Greenland, and no doubt elsewhere. The species was originally described from Siberian material, to which our subsp. americanum has obvious affinities (U. Rändel 1977).</discussion></treatment>
