  <description>Plants glabrous or sometimes hirsute. Stems creeping (erect in Ranunculus sceleratus), not bulbous-based, without bulbils. Roots basal and usually also nodal, never tuberous. Leaves all cauline or both basal and cauline; basal and lower cauline leaves similar, petiolate, blades lobed to divided or (submerged leaves) deeply dissected, segments undivided or lobed. Inflorescences 2-25-flowered cymes or axillary solitary flowers. Flowers pedicellate; sepals deciduous soon after anthesis, 3-5; petals 3-14, yellow; nectary scale variable, forming crescent-shaped ridge surrounding but not covering nectary, or funnel-shaped tube surrounding nectary, or distal margin of funnel expanded to form large flap, then nectary sometimes displaced onto flap, glabrous, free margin entire; style present or absent. Fruits achenes, 1-locular; achene body thick-lenticular or compressed-ellipsoid to discoid, 1.2-3 times as wide as thick, not prolonged beyond seed; achene wall thick, smooth or with weak transverse wrinkles, glabrous; margin a thick, low or high corky band or ridge; beak much shorter than achene body or sometimes absent.</description>
