R. Ernst 1962). Some specimens from central California (Alameda and Contra Costa counties) are difficult to assign with certainty to either M. oregana or M. californica. Depauperate plants of the latter species sometimes can be distinguished from M. oregana only by their unequal and more numerous stamens (W. R. Ernst 1967).</discussion></treatment>
