Basal leaves 3-6, 1-(nearly 2)-ternate; petiole 8-15 cm; terminal leaflet petiolulate, oblanceolate to obovate, 2-5 × 2-2.5 cm, base broadly cuneate, margins coarsely crenate on distal 1/2, apex obtuse to broadly acute, surfaces glabrous; lateral leaflets 1×-lobed; ultimate lobes 4-8(-12) mm wide. Inflorescences (1-)2-5-flowered cymes; peduncle proximally nearly glabrous, distally densely pubescent; involucral bracts primarily 3, 2-tiered, simple, dissimilar to basal leaves, 3-cleft to pinnatifid, 2-5 cm, bases clasping, ±connate, margins coarsely crenate throughout, apex narrowly acute to acuminate, surfaces glabrous; segments primarily 3, linear; lateral segments unlobed or occasionally 1×-lobed; ultimate lobes 3-5 mm wide. Flowers: sepals (8-)10-20, white to bluish, oblanceolate, 10-16 × 2-3 mm, sparsely hairy to nearly glabrous; stamens 50-60. Heads of achenes obconic to fusiform; pedicel 10-20 cm.
