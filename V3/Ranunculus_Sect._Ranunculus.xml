D. Benson</section_authority></TaxonIdentification><description>Plants usually Â± hispid, sometimes glabrous. Stems erect to decumbent, sometimes stoloniferous, sometimes bulbous-based, without bulbils. Roots basal, sometimes also nodal, sometimes tuberous. Leaves basal and cauline, petiolate; basal deeply parted or compound (except sometimes in R. orthorhynchus var. bloomeri), blades with segments lobed or parted, margins toothed; cauline deeply parted or compound, similar to basal or with shorter petioles and/or blades with narrower segments (rarely poorly developed in R. fascicularis). Inflorescences 1-50-flowered cymes. Flowers pedicellate; sepals deciduous soon after anthesis, 5 (sometimes 6 in R. occidentalis var. hexasepalus); petals always present, yellow, sometimes abaxially reddish, rarely poorly developed; nectary scale attached basally, free from petal for at least 1/2 its length, forming flap covering nectary (or sometimes attached on 3 sides, forming pocket in R. recurvatus), glabrous, free margin entire; style present. Fruits achenes, 1-locular; achene body discoid, strongly flattened, 3-15 times as wide as thick, not prolonged beyond seed; wall thick, not ornamented; margin low or high narrow ridge or wing; beak much shorter than achene body.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species ca. 100 (19 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> worldwide except lowland tropics.</global_distribution></treatment>
