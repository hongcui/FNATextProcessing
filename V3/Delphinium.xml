  <discussion>Species ca. 300 (61 in the flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>Three Eurasian species of Delphinium--D. elatum Linnaeus, D. grandiflorum Linnaeus, and D. tatsienense Franchet--have been commonly cultivated in North America. Of the nonnative taxa, only D. elatum is sporadically naturalized, as far as is known. Isolating mechanisms in Delphinium appear to be primarily ecological, geographic, and/or temporal. Where these distinctions are disrupted, introgression often exists. Hybridization occurs regularly between certain taxa, particularly in areas of disturbance (e.g., roadcuts, drainage ditches, clearcuts). The more common and easily recognized hybrids are included in the key.</discussion>
  <discussion>Many names have been misapplied in Delphinium. The few misapplied names mentioned in discussions below refer to relatively widespread problems.</discussion>
  <discussion>Unless otherwise noted, the key and descriptions refer to fresh material. Some features may be significantly altered by pressing; they can, however, usually be determined with a certain amount of effort and experience.</discussion>
  <discussion>In the descriptions, "base of cleft" refers to the point where the cleft or sinus reaches most deeply into the petal blade.</discussion>
