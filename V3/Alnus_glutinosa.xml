  <discussion>Alnus glutinosa is cultivated as an ornamental tree throughout eastern North America
        and is available in a variety of cultivars, including cut-leafed and compact-branching
        forms. This species has also been used extensively to control erosion and improve the soil
        on recently cleared or unstable substrates, such as sand dunes and mine spoils. It has
        escaped and become widely naturalized throughout the temperate Northeast, occasionally
        becoming a weedy pest. In Europe the black alder has served for many centuries as an
        important source of hardwood for timbers and carved items, including wooden
        shoes.</discussion>
  <discussion>Alnus glutinosa has been called A. vulgaris Hill in some older literature; that name
        was not validly published.</discussion>
