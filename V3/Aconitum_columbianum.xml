    <description>Roots tuberous, tuber distally not obviously bulblike, to 60 × 15 mm, parent tuber
        producing 1 (rarely 2) daughter tubers with connecting rhizome very short, i.e., tubers
        ±contiguous. Stems erect and stout to twining and reclining, 2-30 dm. Cauline leaves: blade
        deeply 3-5(-7)-divided, usually with more than 2 mm leaf tissue between deepest sinus and
        base of blade, 5-15 cm wide, segment margins variously cleft and toothed. Inflorescences
        open racemes or panicles. Flowers commonly blue, sometimes white, cream colored, or blue
        tinged at sepal margins, 18-50 mm from tips of pendent sepals to top of hood; pendent sepals
        6-16 mm; hood conic-hemispheric, hemispheric, or crescent-shaped, 11-34mm from receptacle to
        top of hood, 6-26 mm wide from receptacle to beak apex.</description>

    <discussion>Available information suggests that Aconitum columbianum is probably not one of the
        extremely toxic aconites (D. E. Brink 1982; J. D. Olsen et al. 1990).</discussion>
