    <discussion>Aconitum maximum subsp. maximum is a variable species. The only other species of
        Aconitum occurring with it on the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands is
        A.delphiniifolium. Aconitum maximum subsp. maximum is reputedly extremely poisonous and was
        used as a source of arrow poison by the Aleuts (D. E. Moerman 1986; D. E. Brink
        1982).</discussion>
