Leaf blade linear, elliptic-linear, rarely linear-oblanceolate, mostly broadest toward middle, less than 1.5 cm wide, margins revolute, apex acute to obtuse, rarely notched or rounded; surfaces sparsely hairy abaxially when young.

Ã—nashii Kral) to produce spectacular, fragrant flowers with red or pink inner petals, and the hybrid is frequent over their nearly identical ranges. Asimina longifolia var. longifolia crosses with A.  pygmaea, particularly along the Suwannee-Okefenokee axis, ultimately to form swarms, the individuals varying in height, degree of arching of branches, flower sizes, pigments, and fragrances. Some of those hybrids were noted by W. Bartram.</discussion></treatment>
