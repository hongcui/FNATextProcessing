A general trend of increased density and length of pubescence, correlated with increased frequency and density of coastal fog, is apparent. Specimens called D. californicum forma longipilis Ewan are so named for their abundance of pubescence; they grow in areas of abundant fog. This subspecies has formed garden hybrids with D. cardinale.</discussion></treatment>
