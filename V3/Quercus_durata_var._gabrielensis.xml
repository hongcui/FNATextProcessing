  <discussion>Quercus durata var. gabrielensis occurs only in Los Angeles County, on the southern slope of the San Gabriel Mountains from La Canada to Pomona. In this area along the lower elevational limits of this variety, occasional intermediates with Q. engelmannii occur [= Q. Ã—grandidentata Ewan (as species)]. These putative hybrids are large shrubs or small trees with leaves that are persistently woolly on the abaxial surface and have coarse regular teeth. Unfortunately, most of these hybrids have been eliminated by the same uncontrolled growth that has largely expirated Q. engelmannii in this area.</discussion>
