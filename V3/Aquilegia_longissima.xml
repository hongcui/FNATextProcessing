B. Miller (1985) suggested that Arizona reports of Aquilegia longissima are based on "unusually long-spurred individuals of A. chrysantha," but it is not clear on what characters he based his interpretation. Specimens from Arizona's Baboquivari Mountains have spurs 8-10 cm long, far outside the range of A. chrysantha, and seem correctly identified as A. longissima.</discussion></treatment>
