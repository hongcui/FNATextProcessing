Leaf blade spreading-ascending, mostly elevated above shoots, oblong to oblong-ovate or spatulate, 4-7 cm, base cuneate to narrowly rounded, margins narrowly revolute, apex obtuse to broadly rounded, often notched. Inflorescences: peduncle slender, 1-3cm. Flowers nodding to ascending, white to pale pink, sweetly fragrant; sepals 2-4, erect, ovate-triangular, ca. 5 mm; petals 6-12(-15), ascending to apically recurved, linear or narrowly oblong, 2-3 cm Ã— ca. 2 mm; pistils (1-)5(-7). Berries 4-7cm. Seeds 1-1.5 cm, slightly flattened laterally.</description><phenology>Flowering late winter-spring, all year on disturbance</phenology><habitat> Sandy peats of slash pine-palmetto flats, savannas</habitat><conservation> of conservation concern</conservation><elevation> 0-50 m</elevation><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><discussion>Deeringothamnus pulchellus commonly associates with Asimina reticulata and overlaps with that species in flowering times; no hybrids between them have been observed. When protected from fire, the elongate and branching shoots of D.  pulchellus and D.  rugelii will persist, but such new growth rarely produces flowers. A conservation measure for such species must involve periodic burning.</discussion><references heading="SELECTED REFERENCES"><reference>Rehder, A.J. and W.A. Dayton. 1944.
