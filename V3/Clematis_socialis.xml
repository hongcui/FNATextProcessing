Leaves: proximal simple, blades unlobed or 2-3-lobed, distal blades 1-pinnate; leaflets and unlobed blades linear-elliptic to narrowly lanceolate or oblanceolate, (3-)4-12(-15) Ã— (0.3-)0.5-1(-1.5) cm, thin, not prominently reticulate; surfaces abaxially nearly glabrous to sparsely villous on veins, not glaucous. Inflorescences terminal, flowers solitary; bracts absent. Flowers narrowly urn-shaped; sepals uniformly violet-blue, oblong-lanceolate, 2-2.5(-3) cm, margins narrowly expanded distally to about 1 mm wide, thin, crispate, proximally tomentose, tips spreading to recurved, acute to acuminate, abaxially sparsely puberulent. Achenes: bodies appressed-puberulent; beak 1.5-2.5 cm, appressed-puberulent.</description><phenology>Flowering spring-fall</phenology><habitat> Openings in wet bottomland woods</habitat><conservation> of conservation concern</conservation><elevation> 200 m</elevation><us_distribution> Ala.</us_distribution><discussion>Clematis socialis, the only species of Clematis subg.
