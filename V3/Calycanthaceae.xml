Also in cultivation is Chimonanthus praecox (Linnaeus) Link, an eastern Asiatic shrub. Chimonanthus differs from Calycanthus in its scaly buds and yellow flowers that appear long before the leaves.</discussion><discussion>Calycanthus contains calycanthine, an alkaloid similar to strychnine, and it is toxic to humans and livestock (W.
