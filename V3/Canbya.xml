Canby, 1831-1904, Delaware botanist]</etymology><description>Herbs, annual, semiacaulescent, very small, glabrous, from taproots; sap clear. Stems branching at and just above ground level, leafy, branches short. Leaves alternate, congested in tufts, sessile; blade unlobed, linear-oblong, fleshy, margins entire. Inflorescences axillary, 1-flowered, much exceeding leaves; peduncle slender. Flowers: sepals 3, distinct; petals 5-7; stamens 6-15; pistil 3-4-carpellate; ovary ovoid, 1-locular; style absent; stigmas 3(-4), linear, radiate-recurved, appressed or adherent to ovary. Capsules erect, ovoid to oblong-ovoid, 3(-4)-valved, dehiscing from apex. Seeds many, brown, oblong-obovoid to ellipsoid, slightly arcuate, 0.6-0.8 mm, glossy, aril absent. x = 8.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 2 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> w United States.</global_distribution><discussion>These diminutive (but handsome) desert endemics are among the smallest plants in the family. Little is known about their life histories, reproduction, ecological interactions, or evolutionary histories, and they merit more field and laboratory study.</discussion></treatment>
