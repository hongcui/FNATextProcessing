  <description>Shrubs, rarely small trees, deciduous or subevergreen, shrubs low, under 2 m, often trailing, rhizomatous, trees to 6 m. Bark brown, scaly. Twigs light brown, 1.5-3 mm diam., densely tomentulose. Buds reddish brown, ovoid, 2-3(-4) mm, apex acute or rounded, sparsely pubescent. Leaves: petiole (4-)5-10(-15) mm. Leaf blade obovate or oblanceolate, (39-)50-100(-125) × 20-60(-91) mm, base cuneate, margins minutely revolute, broadly 3-lobed distally or with 3-5 rounded, irregular lobes in distal 1/2, secondary veins curved, 6-8 on each side, apex broadly ovate or triangular-lobed; surfaces abaxially grayish or silvery, densely tomentulose-glandular with minute, appressed-stellate hairs, adaxially dark green, glossy, glabrous or with minute, scattered, simple hairs.

  <discussion>Quercus boyntonii is a rare and poorly known species of somewhat uncertain distribution; probably it is often overlooked. Some intermediates between Q. boyntonii and Q. margaretta are known. These tend to be larger shrubs, to 2 m with felty hairs proximally but with the rhizomatous habit of Q. boyntonii.</discussion>
