Stems erect, reclining or climbing, 3-25 dm. Cauline leaves: blade 3-5-divided, usually with more than 2 mm leaf tissue between deepest sinus and base of blade, 4-10 cm wide, segment margins cleft and toothed. Inflorescences open racemes or panicles. Flowers commonly blue, 2.5-5 cm from tips of pendent sepals to top of hood; pendent sepals 10-18 mm; hood conic-hemispheric, 15-27 mm from receptacle to top of hood, 13-24 mm wide from receptacle to beak apex.</description><phenology>Flowering late summer (mid Aug-late Sep)</phenology><habitat> Wet areas along streams and in springs, also less mesic locations in woods and clearings</habitat><elevation> 200-2000 m</elevation><us_distribution> Ga.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Ind.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Ky.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Md.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.C.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Ohio</us_distribution><us_distribution> Pa.</us_distribution><us_distribution> S.C.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Tenn.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Va.</us_distribution><us_distribution> W.Va.</us_distribution><discussion>Aconitum uncinatum grows in the Appalachian Mountains, on the Piedmont, and on the upper Atlantic Coastal Plain.
