  <discussion>Adonis annua also has been reported for the lower Mississippi Valley (W.C. Muenscher
        1980), Ontario and Manitoba (H. J. Scoggan 1978-1979, part 3), some of the western states,
        and New England. I have not found more recent records to confirm abundance of the species in
        those regions. Muenscher's report was presumably based on J. K. Small (1933), who cited the
        species as abundant along newly built levees of the Mississippi River. Although the species
        may escape frequently in some areas, the populations are often tenuously established and
        tend not to persist. Records of A. annua from western states were based on misidentified A.
        aestivalis.</discussion>
  <discussion>Herbarium specimens without mature achenes may be impossible to distinguish from the
        closely related Adonis aestivalis, which differs in achene morphology and, reportedly, a
        slight difference in orientation of sepals and petals.</discussion>
  <discussion>Several infraspecific taxonomies have been proposed for Adonis annua; none are well
        supported by observations in the field (C. C. Heyn and B. Pazy 1989).</discussion>
  <discussion>Petal color has been variously reported; in the flora only dark red with a dark
        basal blotch is confirmed by herbarium specimens.</discussion>
