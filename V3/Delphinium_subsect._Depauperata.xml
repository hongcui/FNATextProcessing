Stems 1(-2) per root, usually unbranched, less than 60(-80) cm, elongation delayed 2-8 weeks after leaf initiation; base usually not narrowed, firmly attached to root. Leaves basal and cauline, largest near base of stem, others usually abruptly smaller on distal portion of stem; basal petioles ± spreading, cauline petioles ascending; basal leaves more rounded and with fewer, wider lobes than cauline leaves. Inflorescences usually 1-10 flowers per 5 cm, dense to open, cylindric, spurs often intersecting rachis; pedicel closely ascending rachis (straight), usually less than 2 cm, rachis to midpedicel angle less than 30°; bracts markedly smaller and fewer lobed than leaves. Fruits erect. Seeds rectangular to crescent-shaped, 1.3-2.3 × 0.8-1.4 mm, not ringed on proximal end, ± wing-margined; seed coats without wavy ridges, cells elongate, cell margins straight.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 3+ (3 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> possibly others in Asia.</global_distribution></treatment>
