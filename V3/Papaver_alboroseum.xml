  <discussion>Papaver alboroseum is infrequent at scattered localities on high mountains within the area mapped. It is locally and unusually abundant in gravels below the terminus of the Portage Glacier, near Anchorage, Alaska. Reports of its presence in arctic Alaska are based on misidentifications of P. lapponicum.</discussion>
