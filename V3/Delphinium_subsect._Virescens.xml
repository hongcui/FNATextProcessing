Stems 1(-2) per root, usually unbranched, elongation delayed 4-16 weeks after leaf initiation; base not narrowed, firmly attached to root. Leaves basal and cauline, largest near base of stem, others often abruptly smaller on distal portion of stem; basal petioles spreading, cauline petioles ascending; basal leaves more rounded and with fewer, wider lobes than cauline leaves. Inflorescences usually with 3-8 flowers per 5 cm, ± dense, cylindric; pedicel appressed-ascending, usually less than 2 cm; bracts markedly smaller and fewer lobed than leaves. Fruits erect. Seeds crescent-shaped to obpyramidal, 1.5-2.5 × 0.8-1.8 mm, not ringed, not wing-margined; seed coats with prominent multicellular, transverse, wavy ridges, cells ± brick-shaped, cell margins straight.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 3 (3 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> n Mexico.</global_distribution><references heading="SELECTED REFERENCES"><reference>Warnock, M.
