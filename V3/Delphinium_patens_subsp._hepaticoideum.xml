Leaf blade: ultimate lobes 3-5, width more than 15 mm. Inflorescences: pedicel usually glabrous. Flowers: lateral sepals 11-17 mm, spur 10-18 mm; lower petal blades 5-8 mm; hairs symmetrically distributed. 2n = 16.</description><phenology>Flowering spring</phenology><habitat> Wooded ravines, near streams</habitat><elevation> 300-1300 m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><discussion>Although Delphinium patens has not been reported outside California, subspp. hepaticoideum and/or montanum may grow in mountains of northern Baja California, Mexico.</discussion><discussion>Although it hybridizes with Delphinium parryi and D. umbraculorum, D. patens subsp. hepaticoideum usually flowers early enough not to overlap in any given site with flowering time of those species.</discussion><discussion>Likely to be confused only with Delphinium umbraculorum, D. patens subsp. hepaticoideum may be distinguished from that species by its ringed, unwinged seeds, recurved fruits, and lack of arched hairs. Contrasting features of D. umbraculorum are presence of unringed, winged seeds, erect fruits, and arched hairs.</discussion></treatment>
