Stems 1(-3) per root, unbranched, elongation delayed 4-10 weeks after leaf initiation; base often narrowed, firmly attached to root; proximal internodes much shorter than those of midstem. Leaves basal and cauline, largest near base of stem, others often abruptly smaller on distal stem; basal petioles spreading, cauline petioles ascending; basal leaves more rounded and with fewer, wider lobes than cauline leaves. Inflorescences usually 4-8 flowers per 5 cm, ± open, cylindric to narrowly pyramidal, seldom less than 4 times longer than wide, spurs rarely intersecting rachis; pedicel spreading to ascending, usually less than 2 cm, rachis to midpedicel angle more than 30°; bracts markedly smaller, fewer lobed than leaves. Fruits erect. Seeds rectangular to crescent-shaped, 1.3-3.3 × 1.1-2.3 mm, not ringed on proximal end, ± wing-margined; seed coats usually lacking wavy ridges (present only in D. purpusii), cells brick-shaped (less than 3 times longer than wide), cell margins undulate or straight.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 10+ (10 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> possibly others in Asia.</global_distribution></treatment>
