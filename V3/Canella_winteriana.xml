K. Wilson 1986). Canella winteriana is locally abundant in some areas, but with the clearing and development of the Florida Keys, it is becoming less common except in protected areas, such as Everglades National Park. Nurseries in extreme southern Florida occasionally market canella. It is an attractive, small- to medium-sized, very slow-growing tree.</discussion></treatment>
