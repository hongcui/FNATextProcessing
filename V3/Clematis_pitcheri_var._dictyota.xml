In some parts of the range of the species, however, these character states are not well correlated with leaflet size and thickness.</discussion><discussion>The names Clematis filifera Bentham and C. pitcheri var. filifera (Bentham) R.O. Erickson have generally been applied to this variety or to a taxon consisting in large part of this variety, but the type specimen is referable to C. pitcheri var. pitcheri (W. M. Dennis 1979).</discussion></treatment>
