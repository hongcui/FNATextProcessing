Stems mostly 1–12; branches mainly proximal. Leaves basal (withering) and ± cauline, 1–7(–10) cm; largest blades linear and terete or ± elliptic and plane, ± succulent, 0–1-pinnately lobed; lobes 1–2(–5) pairs, remote, ± terete. Heads (± radiant) mostly 1–5 per stem. Peduncles 2–8(–10) cm, distally usually ± stipitate-glandular and, sometimes, ± arachnoid (at least early, often glabrescent by fruit). Involucres ± hemispheric to obconic (bases pale and ± truncate in fruit). Phyllaries: longest 8–10(–12) mm; outer usually glabrescent in fruit, apices erect, acute, ± rigid. Florets: corollas white to pinkish, 5–8 mm (inner); peripheral corollas spreading, zygomorphic, enlarged. Cypselae (3–)6–8 mm; pappi of (1–)4(–5) scales in 1 series, longest scales 6–8.5 mm, lengths 1–1.3 times corollas (apices visible among corollas at flowering). 2n = 10.</description><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><habitat>sandy or gravelly soils</habitat><habitat>warm deserts</habitat><habitat>often growing through shrubs</habitat><elevation>-10–1600 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Nev.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Utah</us_distribution><global_distribution>Mexico (Baja California).</global_distribution><discussion>Chaenactis fremontii is often the most abundant spring wildflower in the lower Mojave and northern Sonoran deserts, where it is reported to be a significant food source for desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii Cooper). It also extends seaward into the southern San Joaquin Valley area of west-central California, often as hybrids with other taxa (see sectional discussion).</discussion><discussion>The involucre bases described above are characteristic of Chaenactis fremontii and can help separate it from some forms of C. stevioides.</discussion></treatment>
