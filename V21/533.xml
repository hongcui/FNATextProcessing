Leaves mostly cauline; opposite; obscurely petiolate; blades 1(–2)-pedately or -pinnately lobed (lobes filiform), ultimate margins entire, faces glabrous. Heads radiate, borne singly or (2–4) in cymiform arrays. Calyculi of (0–)1–3+ erect, linear to subulate, herbaceous bractlets. Involucres cylindric to obconic, 1.5–3 mm diam. (larger in fruit). Phyllaries persistent, 3–6 in 1(–2) series, lance-ovate to lanceolate, scarious, brown-nerved. Receptacles slightly convex, paleate; paleae linear to subulate, scarious. Ray florets 3–6, pistillate, fertile; corollas yellow. Disc florets 3–4+, functionally staminate; corollas yellow, tubes shorter than throats, lobes 5, triangular. Cypselae obcompressed, oblong to linear, ± ribbed, smooth or tuberculate, glabrous or densely papillate; pappi persistent, of 2 spreading to recurved, smooth or proximally papillate awns. x = 10.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 1:</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>sw United States</global_distribution><global_distribution>n Mexico.</global_distribution></treatment>
