Leaves: petioles 2–8(–12) mm; blades pedately 3-lobed (lobes spatulate or linear), or 2–3-pinnatifid (lobes linear-filiform), 4–30 × 4–20 mm, ultimate margins entire. Heads (2–5) in corymbiform arrays, 5–6.5 × 5–6 mm. Peduncles 7–15 mm. Involucres campanulate. Phyllaries 2–16, linear-lanceolate to narrow-ovate, 3.5–5 × 0.5–1.5 mm. Ray florets 8–12; corollas white, laminae broadly oblong or oblong-elliptic to subspatulate, 3–7 × 2–3 mm. Disc florets 30–40; corollas yellow, often purple tinged, tubes 0.8–1 mm, throats tubular, tubular-funnelform, or tubular-campanulate, 1–1.3 mm, lobes 0.3–0.4 mm. Cypselae linear-oblong to narrowly oblanceolate, 1.8–2.5 mm, margins usually prominently calloused, sometimes thin, usually ciliate; pappi of 2(–3+) barbellulate bristles 1.5–2.5 mm plus crowns of hyaline, laciniate scales. 2n = 34.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><phenology>nov</phenology><habitat>rock and cliff faces</habitat><elevation>1000–2600 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution>N.Mex.</us_distribution><global_distribution>Mexico (Chihuahua).</global_distribution><discussion>Perityle coronopifolia is widespread in south-central and southeastern Arizona, and southwestern and south-central New Mexico.
