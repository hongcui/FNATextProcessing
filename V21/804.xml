The relationship of P. warnockii to P. bisetosa is evidenced by its similar though often reduced vegetative and floral morphology. The two species may have been derived separately from a common ancestor, perhaps a white-flowered member of sect. Pappothrix such as P. vitreomontana.</discussion></treatment>
