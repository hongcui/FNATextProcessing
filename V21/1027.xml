Stems mostly 1–5; branches mainly proximal. Leaves basal (withering) and cauline, 1.5–7 cm; largest blades ± elliptic to ovate, ± plane, not succulent, 1(–2)-pinnately lobed (± gland-dotted beneath indument); primary lobes mostly 2–5 pairs, ± remote, ultimate lobes ± plane. Heads (± radiant, nocturnally), mostly 1–5(–7) per stem (nodding in bud). Peduncles 1.5–8 cm, arachnoid-sericeous to thinly lanuginose distally, not stipitate-glandular. Involucres ± obconic to broadly cylindric. Phyllaries: longest 12–18 mm; outer arachnoid-sericeous to thinly lanuginose in fruit, not stipitate-glandular, apices ± squarrose, blunt, pliant. Florets: corollas (nocturnal) white to pinkish or cream, 9–12(–15) mm (lengths 1.8–2.2 times cypselae; anthers ± included); peripheral corollas nocturnally spreading, actinomorphic, scarcely enlarged. Cypselae 5–6(–7) mm; pappi of 8 scales in 2, abruptly unequal series, longest scales 5–7 mm. 2n = 12.</description><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><habitat>open, loose, light-colored, silty, usually calcareous or alkaline</habitat><habitat>desert soils</habitat><habitat>often covered by or mixed with gravel</habitat><elevation>600–2200 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Idaho</us_distribution><us_distribution>Nev.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Oreg.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Utah.</us_distribution><discussion>Though the derived floral features of Chaenactis macrantha obscure its relationships, it may represent a link between sect. Chaenactis (annuals; pappus scales in regular, often strongly reduced series) and sect. Macrocarphus (leaf blades gland-dotted). Resemblance of its heads, leaves, and indument to those of C. thompsonii and relatives is striking. It appears to form no natural hybrids, perhaps because of its nocturnal corollas.</discussion></treatment>
