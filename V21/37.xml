Phyllaries persistent (outer) or falling, 13, distinct, outer 5 herbaceous (becoming reflexed), inner 6–8 membranous (each becoming cupped around a cypsela). Receptacles convex; paleae of 2 kinds: peripheral purplish-mottled, becoming somewhat fleshy and arcuate-clavate, shed together in pairs with each cypsela; inner 0 or narrowly conic, persistent. Ray florets 6–8; corollas yellowish (minute), glandular. Disc florets 10–25+, functionally staminate; corollas yellowish, funnelform, distally glandular and hairy (anthers ± connate).
