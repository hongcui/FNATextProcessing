Leaves cauline; all or mostly opposite; sessile; blades (1-nerved) lanceolate to lance-ovate, 7–16.5 × 1.5–3.5 cm, bases cuneate, margins entire or serrulate, faces glabrous (abaxial) or strumose (adaxial), gland-dotted. Heads 1–5. Peduncles 1–4 cm. Involucres hemispheric, 10–25 mm diam. Phyllaries 30–38, lance-olate, 12–16 × 3.5–4.5 mm, (margins ciliate) apices acuminate, abaxial faces glabrate, not gland-dotted. Paleae 9–11 mm, entire or ± 3-toothed (apices deltate). Ray florets 10–18; laminae 15–20 mm. Disc florets 70+; corollas 5–7 mm, lobes yellow; anthers dark, appendages dark or ± yellowish. Cypselae 4–6 mm, glabrous; pappi of 2 aristate scales 3–4 mm plus 0–1 deltate scales 0.5–1 mm. 2n = 102.</description><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><phenology>nov</phenology><habitat>open barrens</habitat><habitat>open oak-hickory woodlands</habitat><elevation>of conservation concern: 100–300 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Ala.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Ky.</us_distribution><us_distribution>Tenn.</us_distribution><discussion>Helianthus eggertii is similar to H. strumosus and H. laevigatus; it is distinguished by the distinctive blue coloration of stems and leaves and by the leaves usually 1-nerved, in contrast to the 3-nerved condition typical for the genus. It is listed federally as an endangered species; R. L. Jones (1994) found it to be more common than was previously thought, and it is now in the process of being removed from the federal list.</discussion></treatment>
