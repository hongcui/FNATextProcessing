Ray florets 8–21 (more in “double” cultivars); corollas usually red (white, yellow, or purple in cultivars), laminae spatulate to obovate, 10–35 mm. Disc florets 100–150+; corollas yellow, 7–9 mm, lobes 1–2.5 mm.

The most widely cultivated Zinnia, it is reported to have escaped from cultivation and apparently naturalized in ten eastern and southern states but is nowhere common in the flora area. It is not as weedy as Z. peruviana, possibly because it lacks awns and thus is not as easily dispersed by animals.</discussion></treatment>
