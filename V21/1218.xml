  <discussion>Stevia salicifolia is variable. Some 14 specific and infraspecific names were regarded as synonyms of var. salicifolia by J. L. Grashoff (1972). The variety differs from other members of Stevia in the flora area by its stem and leaf surfaces (glabrous-shiny from viscid exudate of sunken glands); other taxa in the flora area usually have sparsely hairy, not shiny, stems and leaves. The variety is known in the United States from a single locality (Hidalgo County); from Mexico, it closely approaches Texas and Arizona (B. L. Turner 1996+, vol. 2) and it seems likely that it may eventually be discovered in those states.</discussion>
