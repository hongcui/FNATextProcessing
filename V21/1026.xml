Stems mostly 1–5(–12), usually erect to ascending; branches proximal and/or distal. Leaves: largest blades usually ± oblanceolate to elliptic or linear (± ovate in some C. macrantha), (0–)1–2-pinnately lobed, not gland-dotted (except C. macrantha). Heads discoid or ± radiant. Peduncles erect to ascending (by flowering). Phyllaries: outer usually ± blunt, sometimes acute. Florets: corollas white to pinkish, cream, or bright to dark yellow, actinomorphic and ± equal, or peripheral enlarged (and often zygomorphic). Cypselae ± terete (except C. nevii); pappi 0, coroniform (of ± 10 scales), or of (1–)4–8(–14) scales in 1 series, in 2, abruptly unequal series, or in 2–3, gradually unequal series. x = 6.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 7 (7 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>sw United States</global_distribution><global_distribution>nw Mexico.</global_distribution><discussion>Taxa of sect. Chaenactis grow mainly in valley and foothill habitats; all except Chaenactis macrantha, C. cusickii, and C. nevii appear to form occasional natural hybrids where sympatric. Chaenactis macrantha and C. cusickii may each warrant a separate monotypic section and here probably render sect. Chaenactis polyphyletic. Both species share similarities with C. xantiana.</discussion><discussion>The species with zygomorphic and enlarged peripheral corollas (Chaenactis glabriuscula, C. stevioides, and C. fremontii) are closely related, and identification of some specimens requires careful evaluation, especially when fresh corolla color is not evident. D. W. Kyhos (1965) presented strong evidence that the species with corollas white and 2n = 10 (C. stevioides and C. fremontii) evolved separately from within C. glabriuscula (corollas yellow, 2n = 12) via chromosomal rearrangements. That study did not sample very well the large amount of variation in C. glabriuscula, nor did it rule out involvement of other taxa such as C. xantiana. Chaenactis xantiana (corollas white, 2n = 14) is known to form hybrids with C. glabriuscula that also exhibit 2n = 10 in some individuals (P. Stockwell 1940).</discussion><discussion>A series of natural hybrids and backcrosses (keyed below), involving various combinations of the four species named in the preceding paragraph, appears to occur in the inner South Coast Ranges and adjacent southern and western San Joaquin Valley of west-central California. Where Chaenactis xantiana or C. glabriuscula var. heterocarpha is involved, a partial second series of pappus scales is usually evident. Identification of specimens from this area can be difficult.</discussion><key><key_statement>
