Heads in corymbiform or paniculiform arrays. Bracts subtending heads usually overlapping proximal 0–1/2 of each involucre. Phyllaries ± evenly stipitate-glandular, including margins and apices, with non-glandular, non-pustule-based hairs as well. Paleae in 1 series. Ray florets (6–)8(–9); laminae deep yellow, 2–4 mm. Disc florets (10–)15–18(–21), all or mostly functionally staminate; anthers yellow or brownish. Pappi usually of 8–13, subulate to quadrate, fringed to deeply erose scales 0.1–0.8 mm, sometimes fimbriate crowns. 2n = 24.</description><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><habitat>alkaline meadows</habitat><habitat>edges of alkali barrens or sinks</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>100–200 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><discussion>Deinandra bacigalupii occurs in the eastern San Francisco Bay area (Livermore Valley).
