Strother</author><description>Annuals, 10–120(–300+) cm. Stems erect, distally branched. Leaves cauline; mostly alternate (distal sometimes opposite); petiolate (proximal) or sessile; blades mostly lanceolate, oblanceolate, or ovate, bases mostly cuneate, margins coarsely toothed to crenate or ± entire, faces ± scabrellous and/or ± hispid. Heads radiate, borne singly or in (leafy to bracteate) loose, corymbiform arrays. Involucres ± turbinate to hemispheric, 5–12 mm diam. Phyllaries persistent (outer), (8–)10 in 2 series (outer 4–5 becoming reflexed, usually lance-linear, narrower and shorter than inner). Receptacles an outer ring supporting ray florets plus an inner column supporting disc florets, paleate (paleae linear, conduplicate). Ray florets (4–)5, pistillate, fertile; corollas lemon to bright yellow. Disc florets 12–25+, functionally staminate; corollas dull yellow to brownish, tubes shorter than funnelform throats, lobes 5, deltate. Cypselae obcompressed, oblanceolate to obovate (winged, faces ± scabrous to scabrellous; each shed with its subtending phyllary and 2 contiguous paleae with their florets); pappi 0 (shoulders of cypsela wings often projecting as deltate to cornute processes, sometimes interpreted as pappus). x = 8.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 1:</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>sc United States</global_distribution><global_distribution>n Mexico.</global_distribution></treatment>
