  <description>Annuals, 1–20 cm. Stems ± erect (branches often divaricate, hispidulous,
    stipitate-glandular). Leaves basal and/or cauline; proximal opposite, distal alternate (often in
    clusters of 2–3+ immediately proximal to branches); sessile; blades linear, margins entire or
    toothed, faces hirsute and (distal leaves) glandular-puberulent. Heads radiate, borne singly or
    in corymbiform arrays or glomerules (peduncles filiform). Peduncular bracts: pit-glands,
    tack-glands, or spines 0. Involucres ± obovoid, (1–)2–4 mm diam. Phyllaries 3–5 in 1 series
    (each mostly or wholly enveloping a ray ovary, ± oblanceolate, herbaceous, abaxially hirsute and
    glandular-hirtellous). Receptacles flat to convex, glabrous or sparsely setulose, paleate
    (paleae falling, in 1 series between rays and discs, connate). Ray florets 3–5, pistillate,
    fertile; corollas pale yellow. Disc florets 1–2, bisexual, fertile; corollas pale yellow,
    (pubescent) tubes about equaling funnelform throats, lobes 5, deltate (anthers yellow; styles
    glabrous proximal to branches). Ray cypselae (black) obcompressed (arcuate, basal attachments
    centered, apices minutely beaked, beaks straight, oriented adaxially, 0.1–0.15 mm, faces
    sparsely hispidulous or glabrate); pappi 0. Disc cypselae (black) ± terete, clavate (±
    hispidulous, apices minutely beaked, beaks straight, oriented vertically, 0.1–0.15 mm); pappi 0.

  <discussion>Hemizonella is treated as distinct from Madia based on morphologic, cytologic, and
    molecular evidence (S. Carlquist et al. 2003). Unlike members of Madia, Hemizonella has
    obcompressed ray cypselae and hairy (ray and disc) fruits. D. D. Keck (1949) suggested that a
    somatic count of 2n = 32 for H. minima was evidence for a close relationship between Hemizonella
    and the morphologically similar Madia exigua (2n = 32). Keck’s count contrasts with a subsequent
    meiotic count of 2n = 21–22 II for H. minima. Hemizonella was resolved as the sister-group of
    Kyhosia in a phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ribosomal DNA (B. G. Baldwin 1996). The molecular
    data and morphologic resemblance of Hemizonella to M. exigua are consistent with the possibility
    that Hemizonella may be an ancient allopolyploid descended from a hybrid between ancestors with
    n = 6 (like Kyhosia) and n = 16 (like M. exigua).</discussion>
