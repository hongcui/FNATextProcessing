  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Perennials or subshrubs [shrubs], 30–80[–250+] cm. Leaves mostly cauline [basal]; mostly alternate (proximal sometimes opposite); petiolate; blades deltate to cordate [ovate to lanceolate], sometimes ± palmately 3-lobed [dissected], ultimate margins [entire] toothed, faces ± strigillose [often whitened with close-set hairs) and/or gland-dotted. Heads radiate [discoid], in loose, corymbiform [paniculiform] arrays [borne singly]. Calyculi 0. Involucres hemispheric. Phyllaries persistent, 10–25 in 2–3+ series (distinct, lanceolate to linear, subequal, ± herbaceous). Receptacles convex to conic, paleate (paleae often greenish, ± conduplicate, herbaceous to scarious, entire or 3-toothed). Ray florets [0, or 4–]8–10, pistillate, fertile; corollas yellow (laminae often with 9–12+ brownish nerves). Disc florets 30–100+, bisexual, fertile; corollas yellow, tubes shorter than or about equaling cylindric to urceolate throats (bases of tubes often dilated over tops of ovaries and/or cypselae, tubes and throats often glandular-puberulent), lobes 5, deltate; anther thecae dark; stigmatic papillae continuous. Cypselae (blackish) ± compressed [clavate to prismatic, ± 3–4-angled], often arcuate, glabrous [hairy]; pappi 0 (ray and disc) [of 3–8, subulate to setiform scales or bristles (ray)].</description><number_of_infrataxa>Genera 3, species 13 (1 species in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>sw United States</global_distribution><global_distribution>Mexico.</global_distribution><discussion>Other members of Zaluzaniinae in the sense of H.
