Strother</author><description>Annuals or perennials, 10–20(–30+) cm. Stems prostrate to erect, usually branched ± throughout. Leaves cauline; opposite; petiolate [± sessile]; blades (usually 3-nerved) ovate to rhombic or lanceolate [linear to filiform], bases ± cuneate, margins entire or toothed, faces sparsely pilose to strigillose, glabrescent. Heads radiate or discoid [disciform], borne singly at tips of branches [corymbiform arrays]. Involucres ± hemispheric to ovoid, 3–6+ mm diam. Phyllaries persistent, 8–15+ in 1–3 series (distinct, ovate to linear, subequal or outer longer). Receptacles conic, paleate (paleae falling with fruit, ± navicular, membranous to scarious, each about equaling subtended floret). Ray florets 0 or 5–20+, pistillate, fertile; corollas yellow to orange [white or purplish] (laminae ovate to linear) [wanting]. Disc florets 25–100(–200+) bisexual, fertile; corollas yellow [orange], tubes shorter than campanulate throats, lobes 4–5, deltate. Cypselae 2–3-angled (peripheral) or strongly compressed, ellipsoid to obovoid (glabrous or ciliate on the 2–3 angles or ribs); pappi 0, or fragile, of 1–3 awnlike bristles. x = 13.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 30 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>s United States</global_distribution><global_distribution>Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution>West Indies</global_distribution><global_distribution>Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution>South America</global_distribution><global_distribution>introduced in Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution>Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution>Pacific Islands</global_distribution><global_distribution>Australia.</global_distribution><discussion>Acmella pilosa R.
