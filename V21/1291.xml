Nesom</author><description>Perennials or subshrubs, 30–80+ cm (plants not viscid). Stems decumbent to erect, much branched from bases. Leaves cauline; mostly opposite (distal sometimes alternate); petiolate; blades usually 3-nerved, deltate to ovate, margins crenate-dentate, faces pubescent or glabrous, sometimes gland-dotted. Heads discoid, in loose, corymbiform to paniculiform arrays. Involucres ± campanulate, 4–7 mm diam. Phyllaries persistent, 20–25 in 3–4 series, 2- or 4-nerved, lance-ovate to lanceolate, unequal (herbaceous to chartaceous). Receptacles convex, epaleate. Florets 25–35; corollas white or yellowish white, throats funnelform (lengths 2.5–4 times diams.); styles: bases not enlarged, glabrous, branches narrowly clavate. Cypselae prismatic, 5(–7)-ribbed, puberulent; pappi readily falling or fragile, of ca. 25 barbellate bristles in 1 series. x = 10.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 2 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>sw United States</global_distribution><global_distribution>n Mexico.</global_distribution><discussion>B. L. Turner (1988c, 1994c, 1996+) placed Brickelliastrum, Asanthus, and the Mexican genus Dyscritogyne R. M. King &amp; H. Robinson within Steviopsis R. M. King &amp; H. Robinson. All four are essentially segregates of Brickellia, distinguished especially by their lack of pubescent swellings at bases of stylar shafts. As noted by Turner, this aggregate forms a heterogeneous group; the finer division is followed here until further evidence indicates a better taxonomic disposition.</discussion></treatment>
