  <discussion>Pectis ×floridana is a triploid hybrid between P. glaucescens (2n = 48) and P. prostrata (2n = 24). The hybrids have been observed where the parental taxa grow together in roadside habitats in southern Florida. At the type locality, the hybrids were nearly as common as the parentals. Meiosis in the hybrids is very irregular; resulting pollen grains are malformed and variable in size and apparently all sterile. No fruits have been observed. Regeneration of the hybrids from season to season apparently requires new hybridization events.</discussion>
  <discussion>The hybrids superficially resemble Pectis linearifolia from which they differ in having spicy-scented rather than lemon-scented herbage, longer peduncles, and strongly carinate phyllaries that cohere at the bases and fall together as a group.</discussion>
