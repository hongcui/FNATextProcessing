  </place_of_publication></TaxonIdentification><description>Shrubs, 30–150 cm. Stems much branched from bases, pubescent, often gland-dotted. Leaves opposite; petioles 4–12 mm; blades 3-nerved from bases, broadly ovate to deltate, 10–60 × 10–30 mm, bases truncate, has-tate, or subcordate, margins usually toothed (1–3 sets of sharp teeth near bases), rarely subentire, apices attenuate, faces minutely pubescent. Heads in loose, paniculiform arrays. Peduncles 5–40 mm, pubescent and sometimes gland-dotted. Involucres cylindric to campanulate, 8–12 mm. Phyllaries 17–22 in 4–6 series, greenish, often purple-tinged, 4–5-striate, unequal, margins scarious (apices acute to acuminate or mucronate, minutely pubescent); outer lance-ovate to narrowly lanceolate (glabrous or sparsely pubescent), inner narrowly lanceolate to linear (glabrous). Florets 13–25; corollas pale yellow-green, often purple-tinged, 7–8.2 mm. Cypselae 3–5 mm, hispidulous, strigose, or glandular-pubescent; pappi of 28–40 smooth or barbellulate bristles.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Varieties 3 (2 in the flora}:</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>sw United States</global_distribution><global_distribution>n Mexico.</global_distribution><key><key_statement>
