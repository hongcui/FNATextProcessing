Leaves: petioles 12–40 mm; blades usually cordate to subreniform, 8–40(–50) × 8–50(–60) mm, margins irregularly dentate, laciniate, or ± 3-lobed, seldom more divided. Heads borne singly or (2–3) in corymbiform arrays, 8–10 × 7–14 mm. Peduncles 10–70 mm. Involucres campanulate to hemispheric. Phyllaries 28–36, lanceolate to linear, seldom oblanceolate, 5–9 × 0.5–1.6 mm, apices acute to short- or long-attenuate. Ray florets usually 12–18 (sometimes 0 or 1–6 in plants from w Presidio County); corollas yellow, laminae oblong, 4–10 × 2–4 mm. Disc florets 60–100; corollas yellow, tubes 1–1.3 mm, throats tubular, 2.5–3.2 mm, lobes 0.4–0.6 mm. Cypselae linear-elliptic to narrowly oblanceolate, (2–)3–4 mm, margins usually prominently calloused (sometimes thin), usually densely ciliate, sometimes short-hairy; pappi 0 or of 1(–2) usually antrorsely, sometimes erectly or retrorsely barbellate, bristles (1–)3–4(–6) mm plus crowns of hyaline, laciniate scales. 2n = 34.</description><phenology>year</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>winter</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>nov</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>dec</phenology><phenology>jan</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>feb</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>round</phenology><habitat>igneous or limestone rock or soil</habitat><elevation>700–2000 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Tex.</us_distribution><global_distribution>Mexico (Chihuahua).</global_distribution><discussion>Perityle parryi occurs in southern Presidio and Brewster counties.
