Heads radiate, in loose, corymbiform arrays. Involucres ± hemispheric or broader, 10–18+ mm diam. Phyllaries persistent, 12–21+ in ± 2 series (reflexed in fruit, distinct, ± oblanceolate or lanceolate to lance-attenuate, subequal, thin-herbaceous, margins membranous, sometimes purplish, apices usually attenuate to ± caudate). Receptacles convex, pitted, epaleate. Ray florets 10–21+, pistillate, fertile; corollas yellow. Disc florets 30–80+, bisexual, fertile; corollas yellow, tubes longer than funnelform throats, lobes 5, ± lanceolate (usually longer than throats).
