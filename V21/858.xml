H. Raven 1963c). The species are very similar morphologically, and conclusive identification of specimens sometimes is difficult without knowing where the plant was collected. Both L. glaberrima and L. kunthii are self-pollinating and are found in vernal pools or other seasonally wet habitats.</discussion></treatment>
