Strother</author><description>Perennials or subshrubs [shrubs], 30–80[–250+] cm. Stems erect, branched. Leaves cauline; mostly alternate (proximal sometimes opposite); petiolate; blades deltate to cordate [ovate to lanceolate], sometimes ± palmately 3-lobed [dissected], ultimate margins [entire] toothed, faces ± strigillose [often whitened with close-set hairs] and/or gland-dotted. Heads radiate [discoid], in loose, corymbiform [paniculiform] arrays. Involucres hemispheric, 4–8 mm diam. Phyllaries persistent, 10–25 in 2–3+ series (distinct, lanceolate to linear, subequal, ± herbaceous). Receptacles convex to conic, paleate (paleae often greenish, ± conduplicate, herbaceous to scarious, entire or 3-toothed). Ray florets [0 or 4–]8–10, pistillate, fertile; corollas yellow (laminae often with 9–12+ brownish nerves). Disc florets 30–100+, bisexual, fertile; corollas yellow, tubes shorter than or about equaling cylindric to urceolate throats (bases of tubes often dilated over tops of ovaries and/or cypselae), lobes 5, ± deltate. Cypselae (blackish) ± compressed [clavate to prismatic, ± 3–4-angled], often arcuate, glabrous [hairy]; pappi 0 (ray and disc) [of 3–8, subulate to setiform scales or bristles (ray)]. x = 17, 18.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 10 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution>sw United States</global_distribution><global_distribution>Mexico.</global_distribution></treatment>
