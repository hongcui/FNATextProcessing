P. Tibor (2001) treated it as uncommon. It combines characteristics of E. lanatum and E. confertiflorum var. confertiflorum. Populations have been found as close as 10 m to either species. L. Constance (1937, p. 106) commented that it might be an “evolutionary link” between them.</discussion></treatment>
