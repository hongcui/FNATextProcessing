Leaves cauline; opposite (all or proximal) or alternate (distal); sessile [petiolate]; blades rhombic to lanceolate or oblanceolate [elliptic, spatulate, trullate], margins entire or toothed, faces glabrous or puberulent to pilose [scabrellous, strigose], gland-dotted (at least abaxial). Heads radiate [discoid], in corymbiform arrays [borne singly, in paniculiform arrays]. Calyculi 0. Involucres campanulate [hemispheric, sometimes gibbous]. Phyllaries persistent, [3–]10–13 in 2 series (distinct [connate], subequal to unequal, outer 5–6 oblong [lanceolate, linear, suborbiculate], herbaceous [accrescent], inner narrower, more scarious). Receptacles conic to hemispheric, paleate (paleae oblong to lanceolate, membranous to scarious, plane to cucullate). Ray florets [0 or 1–]6–18[–20], pistillate, fertile; corollas yellow [purplish or whitish] (tubes hairy at bases [glabrous], apices of laminae usually notably 3-lobed). Disc florets [3–]100[–200+], bisexual, fertile [functionally staminate]; corollas yellow [green, orange], tubes (cylindric, hairy) shorter [longer] than campanulate [cylindric, funnelform] throats, lobes 5, deltate to lance-ovate; anther thecae dark; stigmatic papillae in 2 lines [0]. Cypselae ± prismatic to terete [ellipsoid, obovoid], weakly compressed, 3–4-angled, glabrous (shining); pappi 0.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Genera 6, species 32 (1 species in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><introduced>introduced;</introduced><global_distribution>mostly New World</global_distribution><global_distribution>some Old World.</global_distribution><discussion>H. Robinson (1981) removed genera from traditional Milleriinae and placed them in other tribes and in other subtribes of Heliantheae. Members of Milleriinae (in the sense of Robinson) are mostly Mexican and Central American. Guizotia is unusual in being centered in Africa.</discussion></treatment>
