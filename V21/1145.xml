    <description>Perennials, (10–)20–80(–120) cm. Leaves mostly basal and/or cauline; alternate;
        petiolate or sessile; blades 1- or 3-nerved, mostly elliptic, linear, oblanceolate, ovate,
        or spatulate, margins entire, faces usually glabrous, gland-dotted. Heads discoid, borne
        singly or in open, corymbiform arrays. Calyculi 0. Involucres turbinate to obconic or
        hemispheric. Phyllaries persistent, 10–20 in 2+ series (distinct, narrowly oblong to
        linear-elliptic or lance-subulate, subequal, herbaceous, basally thickened-keeled, sometimes
        callous- or scarious-margined). Receptacles convex to conic, paleate (paleae mostly linear
        to filiform, herbaceous). Ray florets 0. Disc florets (20–)45–90(–160+), bisexual, fertile;
        corollas lavender, pink, purple, or white, tubes much longer than to equaling funnelform
        throats, lobes 5, lance-linear to linear-oblong; anther thecae cream to purple; stigmatic
        papillae in 2 lines. Cypselae stoutly obpyramidal, 5(–6)-angled, hairy; pappi persistent, of
        5(–6) lance-deltate to lance-attenuate, scarious (often hyaline) scales.</description>

    <discussion>Marshalliinae was related to epaleate subtribes of Heliantheae by H. Robinson
        (1981), rather than to Eupatorieae, as suggested by T. F. Stuessy (1977[1978]) and by B. L.
        Turner and A. M. Powell (1977[1978]). B. G. Baldwin and B. L. Wessa (2000) suggested that
        Marshallia may be sister to Gaillardiinae and results presented by Baldwin et al. (2002)
        showed Marshallia nested in Gaillardiinae, near Pelucha S. Watson, Psathyrotes, and
        Trichoptilium.</discussion>
