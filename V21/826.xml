  <discussion>Perityle ambrosiifolia occurs in the vicinity of Clifton and Morenci in Greenlee County. Most heads are discoid; 1 or 2 ray florets sometimes appear on isolated heads; color of the laminae is not known; only dried specimens without the ray color noted have been examined. The species was first recognized by E. L. Greene in 1900; no record exists that the species as proposed by him was formally published. Perityle ambrosiifolia is morphologically and geographically distinct from P. lemmonii and may have resulted from either intrasectional or intersectional hybridization between two of several possible taxa.</discussion>
