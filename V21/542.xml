Cypselae 2.5–4 mm, mostly puberulent (ray cypselae abaxially glabrous); ray pappi of 2–3 slender, aristate scales 1.5–2.5 mm plus 2–10 lacerate scales or bristles; disc pappi of 4–15, antrorsely scabrid bristles or aristate scales 2–3 mm plus 0–15 bristles or scales. 2n = 72.</description><phenology>year round</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>winter</phenology><phenology>fall</phenology><phenology>nov</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>dec</phenology><phenology>jan</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>oct</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>feb</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><phenology>sep</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><habitat>sandy soils</habitat><elevation>0–10 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Fla.</us_distribution><global_distribution>West Indies (Puerto Rico)</global_distribution><global_distribution>West Indies (Lesser Antilles)</global_distribution><global_distribution>South America (Suriname).</global_distribution><discussion>Pectis humifusa has been reported once from Florida (D. J. Keil 1975c), where it is probably adventive. In the Lesser Antilles, it occurs most frequently in the salt spray zone near the seashore; on some islands, it occurs inland as well.</discussion></treatment>
