  <discussion>Variety gracilis is a relatively tall plant with serrate, narrow, strongly bicolor leaves, confined mainly to meadows west of the Cascade Mountains, from northwestern California northward through western Oregon to southern Washington. From there, an expression with increasingly broad leaflets transitional to var. fastigiata, represented by Potentilla alaskana and P. blaschkeana, extends in the coastal mountains to southern Alaska.</discussion>
  <discussion>References to var. gracilis from the Canadian prairie provinces (B. Boivin 1967–1979) correspond to the Potentilla filipes Rydberg extreme of P. pulcherrima. The two are superficially similar; var. gracilis has more sharply and deeply serrate leaflets and lacks the conspicuous glands and contrasting leaflet veins of the latter. The inclusion of Saskatchewan in the range of var. gracilis by H. J. Scoggan (1978–1979, part 3) is most likely based on var. flabelliformis or its intergrades with other varieties.</discussion>
