  <discussion>Potentilla jepsonii (a replacement name for P. pensylvanica var. ovium) is widespread at higher elevations in the Intermountain Region, extending into the Sierra Nevada in California and the Rocky Mountains in Idaho and Wyoming. Disjunct occurrences are known on the north rim of the Grand Canyon and San Francisco Peaks, Arizona, and Steens Mountain, Oregon. Collections have most commonly been included in P. pensylvanica (for example, B. Ertter 1993; N. H. Holmgren 1997b); they differ in leaf division, vestiture, and epicalyx bractlets. J. Soják considered var. ovium to be a variety of P. litoralis, which has comparable leaves and vestiture; P. jepsonii lacks the enlarged, revolute epicalyx bractlets that distinguish P. litoralis and is for the most part well separated geographically and elevationally. The exception is the montane phase of P. litoralis, which, at the current stage of knowledge, is somewhat arbitrarily delimited from P. jepsonii in the northern Rocky Mountains; collections from Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta and the Okanogan Mountains in Washington are tentatively placed here in P. jepsonii.</discussion>
