  <discussion>Potentilla ambigens is one of the more distinctive species in sect. Leucophyllae, comprising exceptionally large plants with large, coarsely hairy leaves. Although sometimes confused with P. hippiana, P. ambigens lacks the crisped-cottony vestiture of that species and is usually morphologically distinctive even where both species occur together (D. G. Anderson, www.fs.fed.us/r2/projects/scp/assessments/potentillaambigens.pdf).</discussion>
  <discussion>Potentilla ambigens occurs in Wyoming (at least historically), along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains to northern Colorado, and in scattered locations in the high mountains of New Mexico as far south as the Sacramento Mountains, Otero County. The species is of conservation concern in Colorado and has not been documented in Wyoming since 1900 (D. G. Anderson, www.fs.fed.us/r2/projects/scp/assessments/potentillaambigens.pdf).</discussion>
