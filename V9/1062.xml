  <description type="morphology">Shrubs or trees, 5–70(–100) dm, usually main trunk dominant. Stems: trunk bark usually dark brown to dark gray or black, sometimes ashy gray, highly corrugated; &lt;distal branches usually pendulous (particularly in the slender-twigged species), rarely ± spreading (in dwarf taxa and C. exilis), ± strongly flexuous (slightly so in 140. C. teres and 150. C. exilis)&gt;; twigs: new growth usually pubescent, sometimes glabrate or glabrous, 1-year old purple-brown, older gray or dark gray, sometimes gray-brown; thorns on twigs absent or sparse to numerous, usually ± straight, sometimes ± recurved, 1-year old very dark, usually slender, 1–5 cm. Leaves: petiole length (0–)10–40(–60)% blade, pubescent (young), sessile-glandular (young); blade &lt;light to mid green abaxially&gt;, usually elliptic to oblong or narrowly obovate, sometimes obtrullate, ovate, or suborbiculate, (0.6–)1–4(–5) cm, thin to coriaceous, &lt;firm to floppy&gt;, base narrowly cuneate to rounded, lobes 0 or 1–3 per side, sinuses usually shallow, lobe apex acute to obtuse, margins entire or serrate, &lt;very glandular&gt;, venation craspedodromous (semicamptodromous in 142. C. attrita), veins 1–6 per side (exiting mainly or wholly in apical part of blade), apex obtuse to acute, surfaces ± woolly-tomentose (young). Inflorescences 1–4(–7)-flowered, usually highly reduced panicles; branches usually appressed-white-pubescent to canescent or tomentose, sometimes pilose or glabrous; bracteoles usually deciduous, rarely ± caducous (in 129. C. lacrimata), sometimes semipersistent, linear or oblong-linear, &lt;small&gt;, membranous, margins usually glandular, rarely eglandular (in 129. C. lacrimata), adaxially sometimes short-pubescent. Flowers 10–20(–25) mm diam.; hypanthium usually densely hairy, sometimes glabrous; sepals ± narrowly triangular, much shorter than petals, margins entire or glandular-serrate; &lt;petals elliptic or ± circular in C. crocea, C. quaesita&gt;; stamens 20, anthers white to cream; styles (2 or)3–5. Pomes yellow to orange and copper to red (1 face often colored most brightly), usually suborbicular, sometimes pyriform or ellipsoid, (5–)6–12(–15) mm diam., glabrous or sparsely hairy; flesh texture not recorded; sepals &lt;± sessile&gt;, usually reflexed, &lt;sometimes circumscissile&gt;, &lt;non-accrescent&gt;; pyrenes (2 or)3–5.</description>

  <discussion>Series Lacrimatae constitutes a characteristic and often abundant element of the sand plains, scrubby areas, and pinelands of the southeastern United States coastal plain and piedmont from Louisiana east of the Mississippi to central Florida and on both sides of the Appalachians to northern Alabama and southeastern Virginia.</discussion>
  <discussion>Crataegus lacrimata, with conspicuously weeping branches, supplies the basis for the serial name. The widely used vernacular name, summer haw, is particularly apt as in most species the fruit ripens in August. Distinctions from the segregate ser. Apricae are given with that series. Nearly all the 24 species derive from Beadle who recognized 54 species. Those recognized here range from narrowly defined to variable entities lacking clear internal discontinuities. Regional authors after Beadle usually favored a few-species taxonomy, which tended to confuse ser. Lacrimatae with ser. Apricae. The present treatment reflects the substantial variation in stature, habit, leaf size, shape and venosity, indumentum, inflorescence size, and fruit size, color and time of ripening first noticed by Beadle. Series Lacrimatae contains dwarf shrubs as well as larger shrubs and trees, which mostly arrange straightforwardly into slender, very weeping types (subser. Tenues) or more robust, less weeping ones (subser. Robustae) (see J. B. Phipps and K. A. Dvorsky 2008); the bark is highly corrugated and presumably fire-resistant, unlike that of most other Crataegus series.</discussion>
  <discussion>The taxonomy of ser. Lacrimatae and the often subsumed ser. Apricae has been confused by the introduction of the name Crataegus michauxii by Persoon in 1806, first by C. D. Beadle, followed by regional floras. The type is a vegetative fragment at Paris (P) that cannot confidently be aligned with a particular species, or even series, without molecular study, though D. B. Ward (2009) ambitiously tried to equate it to C. condigna.</discussion>
