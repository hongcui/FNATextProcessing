  <discussion>Varieties 2 (2 in the flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>The abaxially white-cottony leaflets of var. atrorubens usually make it easily distinguished from var. thurberi, which lacks cottony hairs and is usually less hairy in general. The two varieties sometimes occur together and intermediates between the extremes are common.</discussion>
  <discussion>The degree of glandularity and the lengths of the central leaflets are greater in the southern populations of both varieties. The glands are less widely distributed on the plants northward and are fewer in northern Arizona and New Mexico. Leaflets are shorter and broader north of Graham County, Arizona, and Otero County, New Mexico.</discussion>
