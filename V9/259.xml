  <discussion>Variety concinna is the compact phase of Potentilla concinna with strictly palmate, short-toothed leaves that are often prominently bicolored. The variety occurs primarily in vernally wet meadows and similar situations in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and New Mexico, and in forested areas of northern Arizona. Plants referable to var. concinna also extend into the primary range of var. dissecta (S. Watson) B. Boivin at least as far as Alberta and North Dakota. No vouchers have been located to confirm reports from Idaho (R. J. Davis 1952; B. C. Johnston 1980). The low elevation extreme is from Alberta; the highest elevations are in Colorado and Wyoming.</discussion>
