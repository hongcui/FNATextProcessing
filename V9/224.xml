  <discussion>Because variation within Potentilla gracilis and other members of sect. Graciles is still far from resolved, taxonomic recognition is given to only the most distinctive extremes and that mostly at the varietal level. The goal is to call attention to areas that need study rather than to provide a full resolution, and even this leaves out some large, widespread populations in both keys and descriptions. The taxonomic placement of some available names, such as P. glomerata A. Nelson, P. longipedunculata Rydberg, and P. macropetala Rydberg, likewise remains unresolved.</discussion>
  <discussion>The vouchers for the report by M. L. Fernald (1950) of Potentilla gracilis and P. pulcherrima from New Hampshire are presumably specimens collected in Coos County by A. S. Pease (NEBC). The three collections differ from one another, corresponding most closely to var. fastigiata, var. flabelliformis, and P. pulcherrima. The presence of such diversity in the same meadow, all as disjunct occurrences, suggests an artificial, non-persisting introduction.</discussion>
