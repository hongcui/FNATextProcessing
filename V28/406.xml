  <description type="morphology">Plants small [to large], soft, in dense mats, yellowish to brownish or golden green to nearly hyaline, glossy. Stems irregularly branched; hyalodermis absent. Leaves somewhat to occasionally clearly complanate, flaccid, somewhat flexuose, not crisped when dry, narrowly lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate, infrequently asymmetric; margins plane or broadly or narrowly recurved on one side, entire proximally, serrulate in distal 1/3; apex slenderly long-acuminate; costa 1/2â€“2/3 leaf length, ending in base of acumen, parallel to slightly divergent, distal abaxial surface strongly serrulate; laminal cells long-rhomboidal to linear, narrow, elongate, smooth or sometimes prorulose by projecting distal cell ends; marginal cells not forming border. Specialized asexual reproduction absent. Sexual condition synoicous (sometimes also with male and female gametoecia); perichaetial leaf apex subulate. Seta orange-brown, smooth. Capsule erect, inclined, or pendulous, ovoid; annulus absent; operculum obliquely and narrowly long-rostrate. Calyptra conic-mitrate, base fringed, often split on one side, smooth or distally slightly scabrous.</description>
