  <discussion>Plagiobryum zieri is a predominantly montane-alpine species that is disjunctively distributed between eastern and western North America. The species differs from P. demissum in the julaceous, whitish or silvery green plants that are usually suffused with tinges of pink. Plagiobryum demissum is invariably red or reddish brown, and the shoots are non-terete. The broadly ovate, flat-margined leaves of P. zieri also serve to identify the species. Sterile collections are more likely to be confused with Bryum argenteum, which is also silvery-green and has a similar leaf shape. However, plants of B. argenteum are smaller, have laminal cells firm to ± incrassate distally and quadrate proximally, lack pinkish coloration and occur in drier, often disturbed or nitrogen enriched habitats.</discussion>
