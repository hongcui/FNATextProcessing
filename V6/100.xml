  <discussion>Begonia cucullata is found throughout Florida and recently has been collected in nearby Alabama (Conecuh County). The Alabama plants are typical of this species except that the leaves and petioles are glabrate to sparsely hairy; it may require further study. The distinction between varieties is not always clear (B. G. Schubert 1954) and they are not recognized here. Florida specimens often are treated as var. hookeri (de Candolle) L. B. Smith &amp; B. G. Schubert, a name that has been put in synonymy of var. cucullata (L. B. Smith et al. 1986). From the morphologic variation observed, it is possible that this species escaped repeatedly from cultivation. It appears to be able to produce abundant seeds; capsules are regularly found on specimens and sometimes are abundant. Known horticulturally as B. semperflorens, B. cucullata has played an important role in ornamental horticulture.</discussion>
