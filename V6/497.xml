  <description type="morphology">Herbs, perennial [annual], or subshrubs, variously scabrous. Stems erect or ascending [scrambling or creeping]. Leaves: stipules persistent, linear-subulate or filiform; blade narrowly ovate to transversely ovate [lanceolate], unlobed to palmately, often hastately or sagittately, 3–5-lobed, maplelike, base cordate to rounded or truncate, margins crenate, serrate, or nearly entire. Inflorescences axillary, solitary flowers or, by upper leaf reduction, forming open panicles [racemes, spikes, or pedunculate glomerules]. Pedicels jointed, at least in fruit; involucellar bractlets persistent, 6–10, distinct. Flowers: calyx persistent, somewhat accrescent, not inflated, not spathaceous, lobes veined, not strongly ribbed, triangular-ovate, often narrowly so, apex acute; corolla rotate or funnelform [convolute], pink or white [yellow, sometimes with red spot</description>

  <discussion>Kosteletzkya is characterized by carpels that are uni-ovulate and capsules that are more or less depressed and five-angled, often bristly on the sutures. At maturity, the capsule valves separate from the fruiting axis as well as from one another.</discussion>
  <discussion>A specimen of Kosteletzkya thurberi A. Gray at MO is labeled “Arizona (Gadsden Purchase) A. Schott leg.”; it is probably a duplicate of a collection by Schott from the Cocospera River near Cocospera in the Mexican state of Sonora in September 1855 (F, NY). Kosteletzkya thurberi is not known otherwise from north of Mexico.</discussion>
