  <description type="morphology">Plants often mound-forming, 0.3–0.6 m, with taproot. Stems usually crowded in older plants, erect to ascending, usually reddish, grayish stellate-hairy, hairs coarse, longest 1.5 mm. Leaves: stipules wide-lanceolate to ovate, 6–8 × 2.5–3 mm; petiole 3–6 cm, 1–3 times as long as blade; blades on proximal portion of stem rounded, those distally with wide sinus, deeply, palmately (3–)5–7-lobed, incised ± to base, 2–6 × 2–6 cm, narrowed to base, margins crenate-dentate, surfaces coarsely stellate-hairy. Inflorescences open, usually branched, 10–20 cm; bracts distinct, ovate-lanceolate to ovate, (7–)10–12 mm, 3–4 times longer than pedicels, equaling or shorter than calyx. Pedicels 1–4 mm, obscured by bracts; involucellar bractlets 3, 8–10 mm, ± equaling calyx. Flowers bisexual or pistillate, plants gynodioecious; calyx 10–12 mm, densely long-bristly; petals pinkish lavender, veins often paler, 12–15 mm; staminal column 6–7 mm, hairy; anthers white to pale pinkish; stigmas usually 6. Schizocarps 5–6 mm diam.; mericarps usually 6, (1.5–)2–2.5 mm, smooth except for dorsal-medial line and several transverse corrugations especially at margins. Seeds 1.5–2 mm.</description>

  <discussion>Subspecies anomala is known from the vicinity of Cuesta Pass, outer South Coast Ranges, San Luis Obispo County, and is distinctive in its hemispheric-mounding habit, deeply palmately lobed leaves, and relatively large bracts that equal the calyx in length. It is listed as endangered in California and is occasionally cultivated.</discussion>
  <discussion>Subspecies anomala is in the Center for Plant Conservation’s National Collection of Endangered Plants.</discussion>
