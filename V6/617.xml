  <description type="morphology">Herbs, perennial, colonial or not, 0.2–0.6(–1.1) m, not glaucous, with woody caudex, usually with woody taproot, without rhizomes or rhizomes not cordlike, 3–10 mm diam. Stems clustered or scattered, erect to ascending, or decumbent to suberect, sometimes rooting, unbranched or branched, solid, usually densely to sparsely hirsute, stellate-hairy, or glabrescent, hairs 1–2 mm, distal stem usually more sparsely hairy to glabrate. Leaves basal and/or cauline; stipules green or purplish, linear-lanceolate or wide-lanceolate to oblong or ovate, 3–8(–12) × 1–3.5(–5) mm, often hairy</description>

  <discussion>Sidalcea malviflora includes local variants and intermediates. It was first described as a coastal taxon; later researchers subsequently included interior populations that shared a few characteristics. Molecular study has shown that the majority of the interior plants are not very closely related to the coastal forms; the species is again considered to be primarily coastal. Two inland taxa remain, subspp. californica and dolosa.</discussion>
  <discussion>Sidalcea malviflora can generally be distinguished by its coastal distribution, its decumbent-based stems, its relatively short pedicels, its relatively large and showy petals that usually have conspicuous whitish veins, especially when dry, and its generally prominently reticulate-pitted and usually glandular-puberulent mericarps that have a mucro. The leaves can be extremely variable, from unlobed to highly dissected; the indument tends to be harsh to the touch.</discussion>
