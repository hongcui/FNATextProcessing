  <description type="morphology">Herbs, perennial, 0.4–0.8(–1) m, sometimes glaucous, with caudex and thick, woody rootstocks, not freely rooting, without rhizomes. Stems mostly single, usually erect, sometimes branched distally, solid (sometimes hollow in older, robust plants), sometimes glaucous, proximally densely bristly-hairy, hairs reflexed, stiff, simple, sometimes also coarse, 2–3-rayed, stellate, 1–1.6(–2.5) mm, pustulate, sparser distally, with minute, stellate hairs in inflorescence. Leaves mostly basal, some cauline; stipules usually early-deciduous, linear-lanceolate, 3–7 × 1 mm; proximal petioles 15–18 cm, 3–4 times as long as blade, distal usually to 1/2 times to as long as blade; blades: basal rounded, usually palmately 7-lobed, shallowly incised, 4–8 × 4–8 cm, lobes 1.5–2 cm wide, margins crenate-dentate, 3–7-toothed, apices obtuse; distal 3–10, palmately 5-lobed, deeply incised, 2–6 × 2–6 cm, lobes narrow, linear, 2–3.5 × 2–4 mm, margins entire or 1–5-toothed, surfaces: abaxial stellate-hairy, hairs 6-rayed, 1.5 mm,</description>

  <discussion>Sidalcea celata has been recognized as a local species endemic to Shasta and Tehama counties (especially near Redding) in the northern inner North Coast Ranges; it was previously included within S. malviflora. Hitchcock’s concept of S. celata as a subspecies was broader and included plants from additional counties that do not match the type very well; most have been re-identified as S. asprella or S. oregana. Sidalcea celata has been confused with S. asprella, S. gigantea, and S. robusta and appears to be variable. Its narrow distribution, preference for serpentine, typical lack of elongated rhizomes, basally retrorsely hirsute stems, presence of basal leaves, and relatively large bisexual flowers and fruits are distinctive.</discussion>
