  <description type="morphology">Herbs, annual, biennial, or perennial, 0.2–0.6 m, trailing stems sometimes to 1 m, usually sparsely stellate-hairy and with simple hairs. Stems usually prostrate to ascending, sometimes trailing, sparsely stellate-hairy with simple hairs persistent on older stems. Leaves: stipules persistent, narrowly triangular, 3–6 × 2.5 mm, papery; petiole usually 2–5 times as long as blade, gradually reduced distally; blade reniform to orbiculate-cordate, unlobed or very shallowly 5–7-lobed, 1.5–3.5(–6) × 1–4(–5) cm, base cordate, margins crenate-dentate, apex obtuse or rounded, surfaces glabrous or sparsely stellate-hairy. Inflorescences axillary, 2–6-flowered fascicles, long-stalked. Pedicels 1–5 cm, usually 10+ mm in fruit, several times longer than calyx, slender and flexible in fruit; involucellar bractlets distinct, not adnate to calyx, linear to narrowly oblong-lanceolate, 3–5(–6) × 1 mm, shorter than calyx, margins entire, surfaces sparsely stellate-puberulent and short-ciliate. Flowers: calyx 4–7 mm, slightly accrescent, to 8 mm in fruit, lobes enclosing mericarps, not veined, triangular-ovate, stellate-hairy, ciliate; petals pale lilac to whitish, drying pinkish or whitish, or faded, veins not darker, (6–)9–13 mm, length 2 times calyx, apex notched; staminal column 4–4.5 mm, retrorsely stellate-puberulent; style 12–15-branched; stigmas 12–15 (same number as locules), purple. Schizocarps 6 mm diam.; mericarps 12–15, 1.5–2 mm, apical face and margins rounded-angled, not winged or toothed, sides thin and papery, smooth to slightly roughened or reticulate, surfaces puberulent apically. Seeds 1–1.5 mm. 2n = 42.</description>

  <discussion>Malva neglecta is the most commonly found mallow in most of North America. It has been introduced essentially worldwide in temperate areas and is usually considered a weed. In some older treatments, it was included within M. rotundifolia Linnaeus, a name rejected because of its inconsistent use for this species as well as for M. pusilla and other species. The immature, mucilaginous fruits are sometimes eaten; they have the appearance and texture of an old-fashioned wheel of cheese, hence one of the common names.</discussion>
