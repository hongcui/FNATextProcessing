  <description type="morphology">Herbs, annual, (0.05–)0.1–0.5(–0.8) m, bushy-branched. Stems erect, sparsely or moderately hairy, hairs appressed, 4(–6)-rayed, normally bilateral and swollen-based. Leaves: stipules persistent, linear, 3–5 × 0.3 mm, apex acuminate; petiole 5–10 mm; blade lanceolate to linear-lanceolate, unlobed, 2.5–3.5 × 0.5–1 cm, not much reduced distally, at least 3 times longer than wide, 3–4 times longer than petiole, base rounded to cuneate, margins sparsely serrate-dentate, apex acute, surfaces stellate-hairy, hairs scattered, appressed, (2–)4–6(–8)-rayed, reduced to simple hairs at margins. Inflorescences axillary solitary flowers in distal 1/2 of plant; floral bracts absent. Pedicels 2–4(–10) mm, to 5–8(–17) mm in fruit; involucellar bractlets free from or basally adnate to calyx for 0.5–1 mm, narrowly lanceolate to linear, subfalcate, 3–7 × 0.3–0.6 mm,</description>

  <discussion>Malvastrum hispidum is local in distribution. The seeds are very thick-walled and persist in the seed bank for many years, but the plants survive only in areas with little other vegetation and will disappear when there is much competition from other species. It appears to benefit from occasional fires. While it is clearly related to the other species of the genus, its dehiscent mericarps, narrow leaves, distribution, and strictly annual duration easily distinguish it. Open flowers are only infrequently seen; most appear to be cleistogamous. Its origins and exact relationships are somewhat obscure.</discussion>
  <discussion>Collections of the species from Iowa are historic; no recent ones are known from there. It is endangered in Illinois and Virginia. There are very few recent collections from Kentucky. Its status in Arkansas, Kansas, and Oklahoma is uncertain. In Alabama it is quite rare and occurs only in a few cedar glades near the Tennessee border. The species appears to be most secure in Missouri and Tennessee.</discussion>
