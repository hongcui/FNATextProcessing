Inflorescences usually compound, sometimes simple dichasia, sometimes solitary flowers. Flowers: calyx 2.5–4.5 mm, lobes 5, 0.5–1 mm; petals 5, pink to violet, oblong-oblanceolate to spatulate, 2.5–5.2 mm; stamens 6, included to ± exserted, 1.7–3.5 mm; anthers yellow; style included to ± exserted, 3-branched; ovary 3-carpellate; ovules 25–60, attached along sutures, funiculi erect.
