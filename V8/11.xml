Stems erect, stipitate-glandular, without nonglandular hairs; spines at nodes 2, 3–5 mm; prickles on internodes scattered.  Leaves: petiole 1–2 cm, glabrous; blade ovate to obovate, 3-lobed, cleft barely 1/8 to midrib, 1.5–3.5 cm, base cuneate to rounded, surfaces glabrous abaxially, strigillose adaxially, lobes rounded, margins deeply serrate, apex obtuse.  Inflorescences nodding, 10–15-flowered racemes, staminate 2–3 cm, pistillate 1–2 cm, axis glabrous, glandular, flowers evenly spaced.  Pedicels jointed, 2–4 mm, pubescent and stipitate-glandular; bracts lanceolate to ligulate, 4–6 mm, glabrous.  Flowers unisexual; hypanthium yellowish green, rotate, 1–1.5 mm, glabrous; sepals not overlapping, erect, greenish, ovate, 1.5–2 mm; petals widely separated, erect, greenish yellow, cuneate-orbiculate, not conspicuously revolute or inrolled, 0.5–1 mm; nectary disc not seen; stamens nearly as long as petals; filaments linear, 0.2–0.5 mm, glabrous; anthers cream, dumbbell-shaped, 0.2 mm, apex with depressed callus, (pollen absent in pistillate flowers); ovary (absent in staminate flowers) glabrous; styles connate almost to stigmas, 0.5 mm, glabrous.  Berries palatable, red, globose to globose-ovoid, 5–10 mm, glabrous.</description><phenology>Flowering May–Jun</phenology><habitat>  Disturbed areas</habitat><elevation> 400–500 m</elevation><introduced> introduced</introduced><ca_distribution> Man.</ca_distribution><global_distribution> n Asia.</global_distribution><discussion>Ribes diacanthum was first seen as apparently naturalized in 1947 in oak woods on bluffs near the Experimental Farm, Brandon, Manitoba; collections were made in 1956 and 1959 and deposited in DAO and the Experimental Farm herbarium (G. A. Stevenson 1965).  Its current status in Manitoba is not known.</discussion></treatment>
