  <description>Shrubs, to 1 m, rhizomatous.  Stems: bark ± smooth to slightly shredding; twigs sparsely  multicellular eglandular- and shorter stipitate-glandular-hairy (hairs unbranched), also unicellular-hairy.  Leaves deciduous; petiole multicellular eglandular- and stipitate-glandular-hairy and unicellular-hairy; blade elliptic to oblong or obovate, 1–8.3 × 0.4–3 cm, thin, membranous to chartaceous, margins entire, usually ± revolute, sometimes plane, eglandular- and unicellular-hairy, apex acute to rounded, abaxial surface eglandular- and stipitate-glandular-hairy, also unicellular-hairy, (± glaucous), adaxial surface scattered eglandular- and stipitate-glandular-hairy, also unicellular-hairy.  Floral bud scales unicellular-hairy abaxially, and often stipitate-glandular- and eglandular-hairy, margins unicellular-hairy.  Inflorescences sometimes fasciculate, 3–9-flowered; bracts similar to bud scales.  Pedicels 3–10 mm, (usually glaucous), usually sparsely stipitate-glandular-hairy, and sometimes also densely unicellular-hairy.  Flowers appearing before or, sometimes, with leaves, erect to horizontal, fragrant; calyx lobes 0.4–1.5 mm, often scattered stipitate-glandular-hairy, sometimes also unicellular-hairy, margins glandular- and/or eglandular-ciliate; corolla rose-purple to pink, rarely white, unspotted or red-spotted on upper 3 lobes, irregularly shaped, clearly 2-lipped due to very extensive connation of 3 upper lobes contrasting with 2 elongate, widely divergent lower lobes, 12–22 mm, glabrous or, sometimes, sparsely stipitate-glandular-hairy on outer surface, petals connate, upper lobe 3–8 mm, lateral lobes 12–22 mm (closely connate with upper lobe), lower lobes 12–22 mm, tube absent due to deep division between 2 lower lobes and between lateral and lower lobes; stamens 10, exserted, ± unequal, 9–20 mm.  Capsules borne on erect pedicels, 0.7–1.7 × 0.3–0.6 mm, multicellular stipitate-glandular- and eglandular-hairy and densely unicellular-hairy.  Seeds with flattened tails; testa tightly appressed.  2n = 52.</description>

  <discussion>Rhododendron canadense is distinctive and is most closely related to R. vaseyi; together they constitute sect. Rhodora (Linnaeus) G. Don (W. S. Judd and K. A. Kron 1995).  Rhododendron canadense is sometimes cultivated for its showy flowers.</discussion>
