  <discussion>Sarracenia oreophila is rare and local, the first pitcher plant to be listed as federally endangered.  Populations are threatened by fire suppression and land drainage.  It occurs in isolated colonies in open wetlands and in shaded woods when fire or pasturing do not remove vegetation cover.  In open, wet sites it makes impressive stands.  It is the only Sarracenia to occur in rocky sandbar deposits along a major river in northeastern Alabama.  It is known from central and northeastern Alabama, adjacent Georgia, and the mountains of North Carolina (Clay County).  Early reports from Tennessee are not supported by specimen evidence.  Sarracenia oreophila is able to survive drought better than other species of the genus.  But, unlike the others, the pitchers do not last well into the summer and usually die down completely by mid July.</discussion>
  <discussion>Sarracenia oreophila is in the Center for Plant Conservationâ€™s National Collection of Endangered Plants.</discussion>
