    <description>Plants (4–)8–30(–40) cm; scape glandular-puberulent. Caudices obvious at anthesis,
        often horizontal and elongated, slender to stout, (often woody); roots reddish; bulblets
        absent. Leaves (2–)3.5–12(–19) × 0.7–2.5(–4.5) cm; petiole slightly winged or slender (at
        least basally); blade ovate to oval, rarely oblong to spatulate, base slightly to obviously
        decurrent onto stem, abruptly tapering to petiole, margins subentire to crenate-dentate,
        surfaces minutely glandular-puberulent or glabrous. Inflorescences 2–7-flowered; bracts
        narrowly lanceolate, 3–8 mm, glandular-puberulent. Pedicels 0.5–2.5(–3) cm,
        glandular-puberulent. Flowers: calyx green to dark green, sometimes speckled with reddish
        purple, 4–7 mm, glandular-puberulent, tube 1.5–3 mm, lobes 5, (2–)2.5–4 mm; corolla tube
        yellow or rarely white with or sometimes without maroon, thick, wavy ring, lobes 5, pink or
        magenta to lavender, rarely white, (5–)8–15(–20) mm; filaments distinct or slightly connate,
        maroon, 0.2–0.8 mm; anthers (3–)4–6 mm; pollen sacs usually maroon, sometimes pale purple
        and speckled with maroon, connective black, smooth; stigma not enlarged compared to style.
        Capsules reddish brown to purplish, operculate, cylindric-ovoid, 6–12 × 3–4.5(–5) mm,

        membrane along edges. 2n = 44.</description>

    <discussion>Dodecatheon frigidum is the northernmost species in the genus. It is found from
        northern British Columbia, southern Northwest Territories (Mackenzie District), and
        northwestern Saskatchewan, and Yukon (including its northern islands), and most of Alaska
        except near the immediate southern coast and Aleutian Islands. The species is disjunct onto
        the Chukotsk Peninsula in the Russian Far East. The elongated, usually woody, nearly
        horizontal caudex is diagnostic.</discussion>
