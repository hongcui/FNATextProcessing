Stems simple, terete, 5–20 dm × 0.5–1 cm.  Leaves mostly in 3s, opposite or whorled, evenly spaced, simple; petiole and blade indistinguishable, reddish green to gray-green with reddish brown spots, narrowly oblong, subcylindric, grooved adaxially, 3–15 cm × 3–6 mm, margins entire except for 3–9 conic teeth at apex, apex blunt, surfaces not glaucous; bulbils borne between teeth, spurs spoon-shaped.  Cymes mostly dense, corymbiform, 0.5–2 dm diam.; branches to 3 cm.  Pedicels 5–30 mm.  Flowers: calyx pale green, not inflated, 8–16 mm, tube 3–6 mm, lobes triangular, 5–10 mm, longer than tube, apex acuminate; corolla orange to scarlet, 25–40 mm, not contracted basally, lobes obovate, 6–12 mm, apex rounded or apiculate.  2n = 68.</description><phenology>Flowering winter, spring</phenology><habitat>  Cactus-mesquite thickets, shell mounds, waste places</habitat><elevation> 0 m</elevation><introduced> introduced</introduced><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Tex.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Indian Ocean Islands (Madagascar)</us_distribution><introduced> introduced also in s Africa</introduced><us_distribution> Pacific Islands (at least Hawaii)</us_distribution><global_distribution> Australia.</global_distribution><discussion>The names Bryophyllum tubiflorum and Kalanchoë tubiflora are widely used in horticultural as well as botanical works, with K. delagoensis usually listed in synonymy as a nomen nudum.  H. R. Toelken (1985) wrote that the three-word original diagnosis of K. delagoensis was enough to distinguish it from other species treated.  R. W. Long and O. Lakela (1971) misidentified it as K. grandiflora A. Richards.</discussion><discussion>The subcylindric part of the leaf seems to be the petiole, bearing a greatly reduced blade with one to four pairs of teeth (P. Boiteau and L. Allorge-Boiteau 1995).</discussion><discussion>This prolific species is an aggressive weed, well established in southern Florida and coastal southern Texas.  In Australia, where it is called “mother of millions,” it is a serious pest because it is highly poisonous to cattle (P. I. Forster 1996).</discussion><references heading="SELECTED REFERENCE"><reference>Everett, T. H.  1939.  Kalanchoë tubiflora.  Addisonia 20: 63–64.</reference></references></treatment>
