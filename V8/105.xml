  <discussion>Micranthes razshivinii is found in eastern Alaska (eastern Brooks Range, from Atigun Pass eastward and from Mount McKinley National Park eastward) into Yukon and in the Mackenzie and Richardson mountains in the Northwest Territories.  Its leaves are generally narrower than those of M. calycina and the teeth are less numerous.  The glabrous inflorescence branches of M. razshivinii readily distinguish it from M. calycina, which has hairy branches.  The ranges of the two species may overlap or at least abut in the Atigun Pass area of the Brooks Range, in the Mount McKinley National Park area, and possibly in the Saint Elias Mountains.  Hybrids would be very difficult to distinguish from the parents but may occur.  They have not been observed in the material examined.  Plants of this species sometimes have been misidentified as M. davurica (Willdenow) Small, a species restricted to eastern Siberia.</discussion>
