Stems erect, pendulous, or prostrate, much-branched, not bearing basal rosettes.  Leaves alternate, spreading, sessile; blade green tinged with red, not glaucous, elliptic-oblanceolate, laminar, 40–80 × 13–25 mm, base not spurred, not scarious, apex rounded.  Flowering shoots (axillary), ascending, usually simple, sometimes branched, 10–50 cm; leaf blades elliptic-oblanceolate, base not spurred; offsets not formed.  Inflorescences elongated paniculate cymes, 50–300+-flowered, 3–25-branched; branches not recurved, forked; bracts similar to leaves, smaller.  Pedicels absent or to 1 mm.  Flowers (4–)5(–6)-merous; sepals erect, usually distinct, green, ovate, lanceolate, or elliptic-oblong, unequal, 1.5–9.6 × 1–3.2 mm, apex obtuse; petals widely spreading, distinct or slightly connate basally, yellow, lanceolate, carinate, ca. 7.5 mm, apex acute or obtuse, mucronate; filaments yellow; anthers yellow; nectar scales yellowish or translucent, subquadrate or reniform.  Carpels widely divergent in fruit, distinct, brown.  2n = 68.</description><phenology>Flowering late winter</phenology><habitat>  Cliffs</habitat><elevation> 0–100 m</elevation><introduced> introduced</introduced><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><global_distribution> c Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America (Guatemala)</global_distribution><introduced> introduced also in Europe (Italy)</introduced><global_distribution> Australia.</global_distribution><discussion>The first record of Sedum praealtum cultivated in the United States is from 1930.
