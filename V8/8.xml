  <discussion>Genus 1, species ca. 160 (53 in the flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>Some genera included by A. Cronquist (1981) in Grossulariaceae are now placed in separate families.  Of the genera native in the flora area, Itea is placed in Iteaceae, characterized by spirally-arranged serrate leaves, superior ovary, and septicidal capsules, leaving Ribes as the only native genus in Grossulariaceae (P. F. Stevens, http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/).  Escallonia Mutis ex Linnaeus f., which occasionally escapes cultivation in coastal California and Oregon and was included by Cronquist in Grossulariaceae, has entire or glandular-serrate leaves, an inferior ovary, and capsules on which the style and calyx lobes persist.  It is placed in Escalloniaceae (see Volume 13), a family of uncertain affinities with about six genera (Stevens).</discussion>
