Leaves cauline, mostly opposite or compactly whorled, densely imbricate or crowded, 3–15 mm; petiole present or absent; blade oblong-lanceolate to narrowly spatulate, obovate, or spatulate-elliptic, slightly falcate, margins entire, apex acute or obtuse, surfaces glabrous, appearing 1-veined, sometimes with 1–2, indistinct, lateral veins.  Inflorescences solitary flowers, pedicellate to subsessile, immediately subtended by 2–3 bracts.  Pedicels ebracteate, elongating after anthesis.  Flowers: sepals distinct or connate proximally; petals connate in proximal 1/2, corolla cupulate to campanulate, 7–10 mm, lobes white to cream or pinkish tinged to rose, margins entire; anthers 2-locular, without basal spurs, longitudinally dehiscent; filaments adnate to corolla tube; staminodes absent or vestigial.  x = 6.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 5 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> n Europe</global_distribution><global_distribution> Asia.</global_distribution><discussion>The three temperate species of Diapensia are endemic to the Sino-Himalayan Mountains.
