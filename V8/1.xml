  <description>Perennial herbs [shrubs], glabrous or hairy.  Stems simple or branched, [± fleshy], ± scaly proximal to leaves proper; scales ± clasping, ± membranous.  Leaves cauline, alternate, pinnately to ternately or biternately compound or divided; stipules absent; petiole present; blade sometimes ± leathery, ultimate margins entire or ± toothed.  Inflorescences usually terminal, solitary flowers [2–3+ flowers in clusters].  Flowers bisexual; perianth and androecium perigynous; hypanthium absent; sepals [2–]5–6[–10+], distinct, unequal, ± leathery; petals [4–]5–6[–10+; –25+ in cultivars], distinct; stamens usually 50–200+, inserted on torus (sometimes called disc) interior to petals, distinct; anthers erect, basifixed, extrorse, dehiscent by longitudinal slits; staminodes absent, intrastaminal glands sometimes interpreted as staminodes; pistils [1–]5[–15], each 1-carpellate; ovary superior, distinct, 1-locular; placentation marginal; ovules anatropous, bitegmic, crassinucellate; styles 1 per carpel or ± absent; stigmas 1 per carpel, ± apical and adaxial.  Fruits follicles, dehiscence adaxial.  Seeds mostly 2–5 per carpel, dark brown to blackish, ± cylindric to arcuate [globose], outer integuments relatively thick, sometimes interpreted as arils; embryo dicotyledonous, relatively small; endosperm oily.</description>
