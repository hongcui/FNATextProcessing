Leaves cauline (crowded proxi-mally); petiole absent; blade broadly obovate, prominently 3-lobed apically (distal unlobed, reduced), (lobes lanceolate to oblong, mucronate), 4.5–12 mm, ± leathery, margins entire, (cartilaginous), stiffly ciliate, apex acute, not or slightly mucronate, surfaces glabrous.  Inflorescences 2–4-flowered cymes, sometimes solitary flowers, 3.5–13 cm, glabrous except bracts purple-tipped stipitate-glandular; bracts sessile.  Flowers: sepals erect to ascending, (purplish), ovate to oblong, margins eciliate, surfaces glabrous; petals white to cream, not spotted, elliptic to obovate, 3.5–7 mm, much longer than sepals; ovary superior.  2n = 26, 52.</description><phenology>Flowering summer</phenology><habitat>  Moist outcrops, rocky ledges, talus slopes</habitat><elevation> 100–1000 m</elevation><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><discussion>Saxifraga taylorii is known only from the Queen Charlotte Islands and northwestern Vancouver Island.</discussion></treatment>
