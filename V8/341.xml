As few as 40 and as many as 100 taxa have been assigned to the genus, and names given to forms, cultivars, and hybrids.  The most recent complete treatment, by H. ’t Hart et al. (2003), provides an excellent summary of the genus and taxonomic synonyms.</discussion><references heading="SELECTED REFERENCE"><reference>’t Hart, H., B. Bleij, and B. Zonneveld.  2003.
