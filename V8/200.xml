  <description>Herbs acaulecent; caudex branched. Flowering stems 10–90 cm, short or long
        stipitate-glandular. Leaves: petiole glabrous or short to long stipitate-glandular; blade
        ovate to orbiculate, deeply 5–7-lobed, 2.2–8 cm, base cordate, truncate, or cuneate, lobes
        rounded, margins dentate, apex acute to obtuse, surfaces glabrous or short or long
        stipitate-glandular. Inflorescences dense; (bracts subtending pedicels sometimes strongly
        fringed). Flowers: hypanthium weakly bilaterally symmetric, free 1–2 mm, cream or yellow,
        often tinged red or green, especially at base, broadly campanulate, 6–8.5 mm, short
        stipitate-glandular and sometimes long stipitate-glandular; sepals erect, sometimes
        red-tinged, equal, 2.5–5 mm, apex rounded or obtuse; petals absent or 1–5, erect, green,
        narrowly oblanceolate, unlobed, 1 mm, margins entire; stamens included 1–2 mm; (filaments
        erect, straight, stout, to 2 times length of anthers); styles included 2–3 mm, 0.5–1 mm,
        0.1+ mm diam. Capsules ovoid, 6–10 mm, beaks divergent, not papillose. Seeds dark brown,
        oblong-ellipsoid, 0.6–0.9 mm. 2n = 14, 28.</description>

  <discussion>Some features of Heuchera cylindrica show great variation, including the type and
        amount of indument on the leaves, petioles, and stems, lobation and shape of leaf base,
        difference in flower size, complicated by rapid growth of the hypanthium during and after
        anthesis, change in filament-to-anther ratio before and after anthesis, relative degree of
        development of bracts of flowering stems, degree of disc development, and relative length
        and degree of divergence of the beaklike styles of the fruit. We agree with P. K. Holmgren
        and N. H. Holmgren (1997) that there is no value in recognizing infraspecific taxa in H.
        cylindrica until a more thorough phylogenetic study can show some correlation between
        morphological variation and infraspecific categories.</discussion>
  <discussion>A new species, Heuchera woodsiaphila P. Alexander, from between 2550 and 2900 meters
        elevation in the Capitan Mountains of Lincoln County, New Mexico, was published just as this
        treatment was going to press, and there was not adequate time to evaluate it or add it here.
        Alexander considered it closest to H. cylindrica, but pointed out that its proper status is
        difficult to determine and that it might be better treated as a variety of H.
        cylindrica.</discussion>
  <discussion>The Blackfoot Indians used decoctions of roots of Heuchera cylindrica for diarrhea
        and as an astringent. The Flathead infused or chewed roots for diarrhea and stomach cramps.
        The Kutenai used decoctions of roots for “aching bones” and tuberculosis. The
        Okanagan-Colville used decoctions of roots as a tonic for the “changing of the blood” and,
        especially for children and babies, to rinse out the mouth for sore throats. They applied a
        poultice of mashed, peeled roots to sores and cuts, and mixed roots with puffball spores as
        a salve for diaper rash. The Shuswap Indians took decoctions of leaves and roots for
        diarrhea. The Thompson Indians applied chewed leaves and roots on sores or wounds and drank
        an infusion of roots for liver trouble (D. E. Moerman 1998).</discussion>
