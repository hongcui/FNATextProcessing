Leaves: petiole (0.1–)0.7–2(–4) cm, crisped-puberulent; blade orbiculate or reniform-orbiculate, 3–5(–7)-lobed, cleft nearly to midrib, 0.5–1.6(–2.7) cm, base subcordate or truncate, surfaces usually glabrous, sometimes puberulent, rarely glandular-pubescent, lobes oblong to cuneate, margins with acute teeth, sometimes revolute, apex rounded.  Inflorescences pendent, solitary flowers or 2(–4)-flowered racemes, 1.5–2.5 cm, axis puberulent, flowers evenly spaced.  Pedicels not jointed, 0.5–1 mm, puberulent; bracts lanceolate, 0.5–4 mm, (with 2 smaller bractlets immediately proximal to each flower), puberulent.  Flowers: hypanthium greenish white to white, tubular, (2.3–)4–6 mm, softly hispid abaxially, glabrous adaxially; sepals not overlapping, spreading, greenish white to white, lanceolate, (2.5–)3.5–7 mm; petals nearly connivent, erect, cream with red margins, whitish or pinkish, oblanceolate to spatulate-obovate, not conspicuously revolute or inrolled, 2–4.4 mm; nectary disc not prominent; stamens nearly as long as petals; filaments linear, 1.3–3 mm, glabrous; anthers cream to violet, oval, 0.5–1.6 mm, apex with cup-shaped depression; ovary pubescence not bristly, hairs soft; styles connate nearly to stigmas, 0.7–1 mm, glabrous.  Berries palatable, dark red to black, globose, 5–10 mm, glabrous, sometimes sparsely puberulent or glandular-pubescent.  2n = 16.</description>
