  <description>Shrubs, branching near base. Stems 10–18 mm diam., stiff. Leaves 2–4 pairs; blade
        often red-edged, apex rounded, cuspidate, surfaces farinose [green]. Inflorescences:
        peduncle stout, 2–5 dm, nearly leafless; cyme broad, 10–30-flowered. Pedicels pendent in
        flower, erect in fruit, 1–3 cm. Flowers: sepals triangular, 2–5 mm; corolla tube 15–25 mm,
        with hairy ring in proximal 1/4, lobes convolute in bud, [spreading] recoiled in anthesis,
        10–15 × 6 mm; nectaries yellow, 2 mm wide; stamens 3 cm; epipetalous filaments adnate to
        corolla in basal 1/4; anthers 2.5–3.5 mm; gynoecium green, 3 cm × 6 mm; pistils appressed,
        tapering gradually into slender styles. 2n = 18.</description>

  <discussion>First collected in the flora area in 1917 by L. R. Abrams (6555, DS), Cotyledon
        orbiculata was locally common for years in coastal sage scrub on south-facing bluffs above
        Newport Bay, Orange County (R. V. Moran 1993, fig. 1), but with creeping urbanization is now
        nearly gone. In June 1995, the one remaining colony was 10 m wide, with just over 100
        flowering stems. This taxon sometimes persists about abandoned gardens in southern
        California north to Monterey County; C. F. Smith (1976) noted it as becoming naturalized in
        waste places in Santa Barbara. It is introduced also in South Australia (P. I. Forster
        1996).</discussion>
  <discussion>The plants are highly poisonous to goats and sheep, and the meat of animals killed
        by cotyledonosis remains toxic even after cooking (T. C. Fuller and E. McClintock
        1986).</discussion>
