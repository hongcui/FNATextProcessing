Species with edible fruits are numerous; C. africanum A. de Candolle, the “odara pear” or “African star apple,” is sold commercially.  Chrysophyllum cainito Linnaeus, the star-apple, is cultivated for its foliage and fruit in south Florida.  The star-apple is distinguished by having larger (3 cm in diameter), several-seeded fruits.  Other species have valuable woods that are used in various ways.</discussion></treatment>
