Trock</author><description>Shrubs or subshrubs, (sometimes rhizomatous or stoloniferous and rooting at nodes).  Stems erect or procumbent; twigs glabrous or hairy.  Leaves persistent, aromatic; blade ovate, elliptic, or orbiculate to subcordate or reniform, coriaceous, margins serrate, crenate, or ciliate, plane or revolute, surfaces glabrous or hairy; venation reticulodromous or brochidodromous.  Inflorescences axillary, racemes, 2–12-flowered, sometimes flowers solitary; (bracteoles closely subtending flowers).  Flowers: sepals (4–)5, connate basally to nearly their entire lengths, (sometimes exceeding petals), ovate, deltate, or cordate; petals (4–)5, connate ca. 1/2 to nearly their entire lengths, white or cream to pink, corolla urceolate to campanulate, lobes much shorter than tube; stamens 8 or 10, included, (inserted at base of ovary); filaments straight, flattened, usually widest proximally, glabrous or hairy, sometimes papillose, without spurs; anthers with 2–4 awns or without awns, dehiscent by pores with ventral slits, (white disintegration tissue present dorsally along connective); pistil 4–5-carpellate; ovary 5-locular; stigma truncate or capitate.  Fruits capsular, 5-valved, globose, fleshy, (surrounded by persistent, fleshy calyx).  Seeds 20–80+, ovoid; testa smooth.  x = 11, 12, 13.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species ca. 115 (6 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies (Hispaniola, Windward Islands)</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America</global_distribution><global_distribution> e Asia</global_distribution><us_distribution> Pacific Islands (New Zealand)</us_distribution><global_distribution> Australia (including Tasmania)</global_distribution><global_distribution> mostly temperate or montane in tropical latitudes.</global_distribution><discussion>Gaultheria is characterized by its fruit and by the stamens having flattened filaments and awned anthers.  All of the species are woody to varying degrees; the growth form varies from erect or spreading shrubs to procumbent or creeping and mat-forming.  Eastern Asia and the Andes mountains of South America are centers of diversity for this genus.</discussion><discussion>In North America, the fruits and leaves of Gaultheria are a food source for wildlife, and native peoples have medicinal and food uses for some species.  Oil of wintergreen (methyl salicylate) is found in the leaves and fruits of some species.</discussion><key><key_statement><statement_id>1.</statement_id><statement>Erect or creeping shrubs; inflorescences racemes.</statement><next_statement_id>2.</next_statement_id></key_statement><key_statement><statement_id>2.</statement_id><statement>Leaf blades 1.5–3.5 cm; peduncles and pedicles sparsely hairy; sepals glabrous; fruits white</statement><determination>5.
