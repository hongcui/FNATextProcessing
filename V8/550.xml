  <discussion>Variety conjugens is widely scattered east of the Cascade Ranges from northeastern California (Modoc County) and northwestern Nevada (northern Washoe County) northward through Oregon to Washington, and in the Wallowa Mountains of northeastern Oregon.  In the Rocky Mountains, it is found in central and northern Idaho eastward into western Montana and the northern two-thirds of Wyoming as far east as the western edge of the Great Plains.  High-elevation plants of var. conjugens in western Wyoming approach var. viscidum in sometimes having minute glands on the pedicels, making a distinction between the two rather arbitrary.  Usually, the scape of var. viscidum is also glandular-puberulent proximally.</discussion>
