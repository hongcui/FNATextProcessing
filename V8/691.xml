  <discussion>Sarracenia flava ranges from the southeastern coastal plain of Virginia and isolated piedmont localities in North Carolina through the coastal plain of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and the western Florida panhandle mostly near and west of the Ochlockonee River and west just into southeastern Alabama, with isolated sites in northeastern Florida.  It is naturalized in Skagit County, Washington.</discussion>
  <discussion>Sarracenia flava is a striking plant, often forming large stands, at least historically.  It is much less common with the advent of drainage and changing land use.  It has one main flush of pitchers in spring to early summer.  It is quite variable over its range with regard to vein patterns and markings on the pitchers, and at least seven varieties have been formally named (see D. E. Schnell 2002).</discussion>
