  <discussion>Dodecatheon subalpinum is known from the high western slopes of the central and southern Sierra Nevada from Tuolumne County to Tulare County.  This high-elevation ecotype might be considered a variety of D. hendersonii, for which the epithet yosemitanum H. Mason is available.</discussion>
