  <discussion>Dudleya greenei, which occurs only on Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, San Miguel, and Santa Rosa islands, is an insular segregate of the D. cespitosa complex and is not clearly separable.  It is extremely variable, in part from island to island.  Extreme variants of D. greenei differ from any plants seen of D. cespitosa, for example in having more numerous rosette leaves or outcurved petals.  Also, certain variants kept in D. cespitosa have characteristics apparently not matched in D. greenei, such as red corollas and comparatively thin leaves that are channeled adaxially.</discussion>
  <discussion>Based on 12 collections studied by C. H. Uhl, Dudleya greenei is tetraploid and hexaploid.  The three collections from San Miguel Island were hexaploid, the three from Santa Cruz Island and one from Catalina Island were tetraploid, and of the five from Santa Rosa Island, two were tetraploid and three hexaploid.  Casual inspection suggests that D. greenei might be derived from something like D. candelabrum, now found on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands, and D. farinosa, now found on the coast of California from Monterey County north.</discussion>
