  <description>Shrubs or trees.  Stems erect; twigs glabrous.  Leaves persistent; blade ovate, coriaceous, margins entire or serrate, plane, surfaces often multicellular, long-stalked stipitate-glandular-hairy, otherwise unicellular-hairy on midvein [covering abaxial surface]; venation reticulodromous (reticulum rather dense and with all orders ± equally prominent).  Inflorescences axillary [terminal] racemes [panicles], 10–20-flowered, (produced just before flowering).  Pedicels: bracteoles 2, near base to ± midpoint.  Flowers: sepals 5, slightly connate, deltate; petals 5, connate for most of their lengths, white [red], corolla cylindric [urceolate], lobes short; stamens 10, included; filaments geniculate, flattened, hairy, without spurs; anthers without awns, dehiscent by elliptic pores; pistil 5-carpellate; ovary 5-locular; stigma (slightly exserted), truncate to capitate, obscurely lobed, (minutely papillose).  Fruits capsular, subglobose to short-ovoid, (with unthickened sutures), dry.  Seeds 120–250, narrowly oblong to pyramidal or angular-obovoid; testa cells elongate.  x = 12.</description>
