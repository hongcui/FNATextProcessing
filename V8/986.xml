Leaf blades white-glaucous or, sometimes, green abaxially, (1–)2–5 cm × 1–8 mm.  Pedicels erect or recurved, reddish or pale-glaucous, 6–20 mm.  Flowers: sepals valvate in bud, soon wide-spreading, whitish to reddish, especially marginally, 1–1.7 mm, apex blunt to acute, calyx saucer-shaped, without stomata; petals short-spreading or recurved, hairy adaxially, minutely papillate on margins, corolla 5–8 × 3.5–7 mm, without stomata; nectariferous tissue at ovary base; ovary depressed-globose; placentae attached next to summit of columella; style ± equaling corolla tube.  Capsules 5-locular, 4–8 × 4–5 mm, deeply depressed apically obscuring style base, conspicuously glaucous when young, glabrous or hairy at base.  Seeds brown, ca. 1 mm; testa smooth, lustrous.  2n = 48.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Varieties 2 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> n North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Europe</global_distribution><global_distribution> Asia.</global_distribution><discussion>Infection of Andromeda polifolia by species of the ascomycete genus Rhytisma Fries appears to result in leaves broadened and reddish, often not glaucous (A.

Boivin] is known from southern Nunavut and from the James Bay and southern Hudson Bay regions of Ontario and Quebec (J. Cayouette 1986); it is characterized by the abaxial surfaces of leaves being both glaucous and white-puberulent.  Other specimens having abaxial surfaces of leaves both glaucous and puberulent are scattered through the range of A. polifolia.</discussion><key><key_statement><statement_id>1.</statement_id><statement>Leaf blades (1–)2–4 cm, abaxial surface white-glaucous (sometimes green), glabrous; corollas 5(–7) mm; corymbs 2–3(–4)-flowered, sometimes flowers solitary, erect or lax, on erect or ascending branchlets; pedicels 10–20 mm</statement><determination>1a.
