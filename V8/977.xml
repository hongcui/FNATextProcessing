Judd</author><discussion>Arsenococcus Small; Desmothamnus Small; Neopieris Britton</discussion><description>Shrubs or trees, (sometimes with woody burl, resprouting after fire).  Stems erect to arching; twigs hairy, sometimes glabrescent (sometimes also lepidote).  Leaves deciduous or persistent; blade elliptic, obovate, or ovate, membranous to coriaceous, margins entire, undulate, or serrulate [irregularly serrate], plane or revolute, surfaces multicellular, peltate-scaled or short-stalked stipitate-glandular-hairy, often unicellular-hairy on major veins or abaxial surface; venation brochidodromous (or reticulodromous).  Inflorescences axillary fascicles, panicles, or racemes, (2–)5–8(–12)-flowered, sometimes flowers solitary, (produced just before flowering).  Pedicels: bracteoles 2, at or near base.  Flowers: sepals usually [4–]5[–8], slightly connate, ovate-deltate to lanceolate; petals usually [4–]5[–8], connate nearly their entire lengths, white to red, corolla cylindric to urceolate, lobes much shorter than tube, (sparsely stipitate-glandular-hairy or peltate-scaled); stamens usually [8–]10[–16], included; filaments geniculate, flattened, roughened or hairy, with or without spurs; anthers without awns, dehiscent by elliptic pores; pistil usually [4–]5[–8]-carpellate; ovary [4–]5[–8]-locular; (style slightly longer than stamens); stigma capitate-truncate.  Fruits capsular, globose to ovoid or ellipsoid, dry, (with [4–]5[–8] pale, decidedly thickened, whitish sutures).  Seeds ca. 100–300, ellipsoidal, narrowly oblong, obovoid to angular-obovoid or narrowly conic, (sometimes tailed); testa cells elongate.  x = 12.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 36 (5 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> e United States</global_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies</global_distribution><global_distribution> e Asia.</global_distribution><references heading="SELECTED REFERENCES"><reference>Judd, W.
