  <discussion>Some species of Pouteria are of economic importance, including the well-known abiu, P. caimito (Ruiz &amp; Pavón) Radlkofer, noted for fruits of commerce.  Wood from some species is important in the production of furniture, heavy wood implements, cross-ties, etc.</discussion>
  <discussion>Pouteria domingensis (C. F. Gaertner) Baehni, native in the Bahamas, Cuba, and Hispaniola and cultivated in southern Florida, was reported as naturalized in southern Florida by R. W. Long and O. Lakela (1971) and T. D. Pennington (1990).  No specimens from there have been seen.</discussion>
