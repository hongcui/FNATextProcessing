Löve &amp; D. Löve</species_authority></TaxonIdentification><description>Herbs, annual, biennial, or weakly perennial, tufted or not, glabrous.  Stems decumbent, branched, bearing terminal rosettes.  Leaves alternate, spreading to erect, sessile; blade green, not glaucous, linear to elliptic-oblong (subulate when dry), subterete, 4.3–13.8 × 1.4–2.7 mm, base (persistent), spurred (spur simple, small), scarious, apex acute, (surfaces sometimes papillose marginally).  Flowering shoots erect, branched, 10–43 cm; leaf blades linear, base with scarious spurs; offsets rosettes, produced from axils of leaves and bracts.  Inflorescences solitary flowers or cymes, 9–15(–25)-flowered, mostly 3-branched; branches slightly recurved, not forked; bracts linear-lanceolate, smaller than leaves, base spurred.  Pedicels absent or to 0.5 mm.  Flowers 5-merous; sepals erect, distinct, pale green or yellow-green, lanceolate or ovate, equal, 2–3.7 × 0.9–1.7 mm, apex acute or long-acuminate; petals stellately spreading, distinct, deep yellow with green to brown dorsal keel to almost white, lanceolate or elliptic, slightly carinate, 5.4–8 mm, apex obtuse, acute, or long-acuminate, sometimes with aristate appendage; filaments yellow; anthers yellow; nectar scales greenish yellow or yellowish white, reniform-subquadrate or square.  Carpels divergent in fruit, shortly connate, pale green, yellow-green, or brown.  2n = 50–54, 58, 62–70, 63–64.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Varieties 2 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> w North America.</global_distribution><discussion>Mature follicles of Sedum stenopetalum are finely papillose, with prominent lips along the adaxial suture.
