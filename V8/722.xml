  <description>Plants rhizomatous, 0.5–1.9(–2.5) dm. Leaves: petiole 10–65(–80) mm, channeled
        adaxially, glabrous; blade not or, sometimes, maculate, dull and light green to purplish
        abaxially, shiny and dark green, sometimes with white tissue bordering larger veins
        adaxially, ovate to elliptic or round to subreniform, 9–33(–45) × 10–50 mm, coriaceous, base
        truncate to rounded or cordate, margins subentire to crenate or crenate-serrulate, apex
        rounded to acute. Inflorescences 1 per stem, 4–12-flowered; peduncular bracts absent or 1–3,
        ovate-lanceolate to ovate, 6–12 × (2–)3–5 mm, chartaceous or membranous, margins entire;
        inflorescence bracts ovate-lanceolate to ovate, longer than subtended pedicels, 4.5–10 ×
        1.8–3.4 mm, chartaceous. Pedicels 3–8 mm. Flowers: calyx lobes appressed or spreading in
        fruit, green, pinkish, or reddish with margins hyaline to white or pinkish, oblong-ovate to
        lanceolate, (2.2–)2.8–6 × (0.9–)1.2–2 mm, margins entire or erose-denticulate, apices obtuse
        to rounded; petals white, often suffused with pink, obovate to round, 6–10(–11) × 4.2–6 mm,
        margins entire or erose-denticulate, especially distally; stamens 4–7.5 mm; filament base
        0.2–0.3 mm wide; anthers 1.6–3 mm, apiculations absent or less than 0.1 mm, thecae creamy
        yellow to golden yellow, tubules yellow to yellowish brown, 0.1–0.3 mm, scarcely narrowed
        above thecae, lateral walls touching for most of their lengths, pores 0.1–0.2 × 0.1–0.2 mm;
        ovary smooth; style scarcely exserted, 4.5–8 mm; stigma 0.7–1.1 mm wide, lobes erect.
        Capsules depressed-globose, 2.9–4 × 3.8–6 mm. 2n = 46, 69.</description>

  <discussion>A. E. Porsild (1939) recognized three varieties in Pyrola grandiflora (var.
        canadensis, var. gormanii, and var. grandiflora) differing subtly in leaf and floral
        morphology, floral fragrance, and habitat. Variation among these taxa appears to be
        essentially continuous. E. Haber (1972) referred them to synonymy [under P. rotundifolia
        subsp. grandiflora (Radius) Andres] without discussion. Hybrids between P. grandiflora and
        P. minor have been reported from western Greenland; they were discussed by T. W. Böcher
        (1961).</discussion>
