In the Rocky Mountains, it is found in central and northern Idaho eastward into western Montana and the northern two-thirds of Wyoming as far east as the western edge of the Great Plains.  High-elevation plants of var. conjugens in western Wyoming approach var. viscidum in sometimes having minute glands on the pedicels, making a distinction between the two rather arbitrary.  Usually, the scape of var. viscidum is also glandular-puberulent proximally.</discussion></treatment>
