Stems ascending to erect, copiously grayish-hairy and abundantly stipitate-glandular, very slightly if at all bristly; spines at nodes 1 or 3, 3–7(–10) mm; prickles on inter-nodes absent.  Leaves: petiole 2–4 cm, puberulent to pubescent, stipitate-glandular; blade broadly triangular, 3–5-lobed, cleft less than 1/2 to midrib, again 2–5 cleft, 2–5 cm, base truncate or cordate, surfaces thickly puberulent to pubescent, stipitate-glandular, lobes broad, rounded, margins coarsely crenate-denticulate, apex rounded.  Inflorescences pendent, solitary flowers or 2(–3)-flowered racemes, 2–4 cm, axis pubescent, stipitate-glandular.  Pedicels not jointed, 2–3 mm, pubescent, stipitate-glandular; bracts deltate, 2–3 mm, pubescent, stipitate-glandular.  Flowers: hypanthium greenish or with some reddish tinge, tubular-campanulate, 2.5–3 mm, finely pilose, sparingly glandular; sepals not overlapping, reflexed, cream suffused with pink, narrowly oblong, 5.5–9 mm; petals connivent, erect, white, pinkish proximally, oblong, not conspicuously revolute or inrolled, 3.5–4 mm; nectary disc not prominent; stamens as long as or slightly longer than petals; filaments linear, 2–3 mm, glabrous; anthers white, oblong, 0.8–1.2 mm, apex rounded; ovary densely glandular-bristly; styles connate 3/4 their lengths, 6 mm, glabrous.  Berries palatability not known, reddish, subglobose, 10 mm, densely yellowish-spiny.</description><phenology>Flowering May–Jul</phenology><habitat>  Canyons, ridges</habitat><elevation> 1300–2200 m</elevation><ca_distribution> Alta.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wash.</us_distribution><discussion>Ribes watsonianum occurs in the Cascade Range of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, and in Alberta.
