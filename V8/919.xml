  <description>Shrubs or trees, to 5(–6) m, usually not rhizomatous.  Stems: bark smooth to vertically furrowed, shredding; twigs glabrous.  Leaves deciduous; petiole usually multicellular eglandular-hairy and unicellular-hairy; blade ovate to obovate, 3–11(–15.2) × 1–4(–5) cm, thin, membranous to chartaceous, margins entire, plane, ciliate, eglandular-hairy, apex acute to obtuse, often mucronate, abaxial surface glabrous, adaxial surface glabrous or, rarely, sparsely scattered eglandular-hairy.  Floral bud scales glabrous abaxially, margins unicellular-ciliate.  Inflorescences 4–7-flowered; bracts similar to bud scales.  Pedicels 5–12 mm, eglandular-hairy.  Flowers opening after development of leaves, erect to horizontal, not fragrant; calyx lobes 1–3(–4) mm, glabrous or sparsely unicellular-hairy, margins eglandular-hairy; corolla red to orange-red or orange, with indistinct darker blotch on upper lobe, funnelform, 36–53 mm, glabrous or very sparsely long stipitate-glandular-hairy, sometimes also sparsely unicellular-hairy on outer surface, petals connate, lobes 11–22 mm, tube abruptly expanded into lobes, 23–35 mm (± equaling or much longer than lobes); stamens 5, much exserted, ± unequal, 64–84 mm.  Capsules borne on erect pedicels, 15–22 × 4.5–7 mm, densely, stiffly eglandular-hairy and sparsely unicellular-hairy.  Seeds without distinct tails, flattened portion of testa well developed at each end; testa expanded, dorsiventrally flattened, ± loose.  2n = 26.</description>

  <discussion>Rhododendron prunifolium is most closely related to R. flammeum, R. cumberlandense, and R. calendulaceum, and can be distinguished from all of those orange- to red-flowered species by its nearly glabrous and more gradually expanded corolla tube and by the indistinct nature of the floral blotch (K. A. Kron 1993).  This species is federally protected.</discussion>
