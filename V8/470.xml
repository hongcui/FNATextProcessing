  <discussion>Lenophyllum texanum is abundant locally, forming mats, often under cacti and other shrubs on the coastal plain and in the lower Rio Grande valley.  J. N. Rose (1923) wrote that it grew most prolifically under glass and was in danger of becoming a pernicious weed in greenhouses, the leaves easily dropping off and each at once starting a new colony.</discussion>
