Flowering shoots erect, simple, 1–5 cm, (papillose); leaf blades elliptic, base short-spurred; offsets not formed.  Inflorescences 3-parted cymes, 2–10-flowered or flowers solitary, simple or monochasially 1-branched; branches erect to slightly recurved, not forked; bracts similar to leaves, sometimes imbricate.  Pedicels absent or to 1.5 mm.  Flowers 5-merous; sepals erect to suberect, distinct basally, green to pinkish, linear or lanceolate, slightly unequal, 3–5 × 0.2–1 mm, apex obtuse; petals spreading, distinct basally, white, suboblong, not carinate, 5–6.5 mm, apex obtuse, shortly mucronate; filaments white to pale pink; anthers red or purplish; nectar scales whitish to pale pink, oblong, (retuse).
