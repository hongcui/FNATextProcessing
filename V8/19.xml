  <description>Plants 0.5–2 m.  Stems erect or ascending (no short shoots), sparsely to densely glandular throughout with yellow, shiny, sessile, crystalline, round glands; spines at nodes absent; prickles on internodes absent.  Leaves: petiole (1–)2.7–9.5 cm, glabrous or hairy, with scattered, yellow, sessile, round glands; blade reniform to orbiculate, 3-lobed, 2 proximal segments less deeply and very unequally lobed (rarely equally 5-lobed), cleft usually less than 1/2 to midrib, 2–12(–13.3) cm, base deeply cordate, surfaces with yellow, sessile, round glands abaxially, otherwise glabrous or copiously hairy abaxially, sparsely hairy adaxially, lobes broadly deltate, margins coarsely bicrenate-dentate, apex acute.  Inflorescences ascending to spreading, 20–50-flowered racemes, 3–17 cm, axis thinly villous, flowers evenly spaced.  Pedicels jointed, 0.6–8(–11) mm, short-villous, short stipitate-glandular; bracts lanceolate to linear, 0.5–3 mm, pubescent.  Flowers: hypanthium white or green, saucer-shaped, widely flared, 0.6–1.5 mm, with sparse to dense, yellow, sessile glands and densely crisped-pubescent abaxially, glabrous adaxially; sepals not overlapping, widely spreading, white, triangular to ovate-lanceolate or oblong-elliptic, 3.4–7 mm; petals widely separated, erect to spreading, white or pinkish, oblong, becoming cuneate-flabelliform and obscurely 3-lobed distally, not conspicuously revolute or inrolled, 0.9–2 mm; nectary disc pale green, thin, partially covering ovary; stamens as long as petals; filaments linear, 1–1.1 mm, glabrous; anthers maroon, sometimes cream, oval, 0.4–1 mm, apex with small-holed callus, sessile- or stipitate-glandular; ovary sessile-glandular, stipitate-glandular, or sparsely hairy, rarely glabrous; styles connate 1/2+ their lengths, 2 mm, glabrous.  Berries bitter, not palatable, black, ± glaucous, subglobose, 5.5–12 mm, glabrous except for yellow, sessile glands.</description>

  <discussion>Plants of Ribes hudsonianum with leaf blades that are pubescent abaxially and mostly lack sessile glands, and have ovaries with sessile glands, have been recognized as var. hudsonianum; those with leaf blades that are shaggy-hairy abaxially and sessile-glandular, and have ovaries lacking such glands, have been named var. petiolare.  Variety hudsonianum has a more northern distribution; var. petiolare is western.  Where their ranges overlap, for instance in Saskatoon, pubescence density varies continuously and does not correlate with presence or absence of glands (V. L. Harms, pers. comm.).</discussion>
  <discussion>Ribes hudsonianum is a major host of blister rust; in early literature it is referred to as R. petiolare (E. P. Van Arsdel and B. W. Geils 2004).  It has a strong, sweetish, unpleasant odor, and bears its leaves on long shoots.</discussion>
