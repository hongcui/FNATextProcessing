  <description>Shrubs or trees, to 15 m.  Bark light reddish gray, smooth and flaking.  Leaves tardily deciduous; petiole 0.1–0.5 cm; blade dark green and glossy adaxially, obovate, 2–5 × 1–3 cm, thick, apex rounded to emarginate, abaxial surface tomentose, without basilaminar glands.  Inflorescences solitary flowers or 2–3-flowered cymes, borne on twigs of previous season.  Flowers 0.8–1.6 cm; sepals 5; petals 5; stamens usually 16; anthers dehiscent by subapical slits; pistillate flowers without staminodes; styles usually 4, connate for most of their lengths; ovary pubescent.  Berries black, not glaucous, subglobose, 1.5–2.5 cm diam., pubescent.  Seeds light red, trianguloid, ca. 0.8 cm.  2n = 30.</description>

  <discussion>Brayodendron, based on Diospyros texana and segregated because of its apically dehiscent anthers, lack of staminodes, and coherent styles, can hardly stand up within a worldwide view of the Ebenaceae.  As well as being eaten by people and wildlife, the fruits also are used in dying.  The heartwood turns dark sooner than in D. virginiana; the small size of the stems limits its use.</discussion>
