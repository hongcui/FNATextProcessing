Stems: bark smooth to vertically furrowed, shredding; twigs multicellular eglandular-hairy (hairs branched basally, crisp/matted), glabrate in age.  Leaves persistent; petiole multicellular-hairy (hairs ± branched), often glabrescent; blade elliptic to obovate or slightly ovate, (5–)6–12(–17) × (2.5–)3.5–6(–7.7) cm (length/width ratio 1.3–3.5), thick, coriaceous, margins entire, revolute to plane, glabrous or sparsely hairy along margins (hairs branched, ephemeral), apex rounded/mucronate to obtuse or acute, surfaces sparsely eglandular-hairy (hairs basally branched, crisped, quickly deciduous), abaxial surface minutely, obscurely papillose.  Floral bud scales multicellular stipitate-glandular-hairy, eglandular-hairy (hairs basally branched, crisped), and unicellular-hairy (hairs short to elongate), margins eglandular-hairy (hairs branched).  Inflorescences 12–20-flowered; bracts similar to bud scales.  Pedicels 10–50 mm, sparsely to moderately multicellular eglandular-hairy (hairs ferruginous, branched, crisped), glabrate in age.  Flowers opening after development of leaves (of flowering shoots), erect to horizontal, fragrant; calyx lobes 0.5–1.7 mm, glabrous or eglandular-hairy; corolla deep pink to purple, rarely white, usually with yellowish-green spots on upper lobe, campanulate, 27–50 mm, glabrous on outer surface, petals connate, lobes 15–30 mm, tube gradually expanding into lobes, 12–28 mm; stamens 10, included, ± unequal, 19–39 mm; (ovary multicellular eglandular-hairy).  Capsules borne on erect pedicels, 10–23 × 3.5–7 mm, eglandular-hairy (hairs ferruginous, branched).  Seeds without distinct tails, flattened portion of testa well developed at each end; testa expanded, dorsiventrally flattened, loose.  2n = 26.</description><phenology>Flowering spring</phenology><habitat>  Rocky slopes, ridges, and balds</habitat><elevation> 50–2000 m</elevation><us_distribution> Ala.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Ga.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Ky.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.C.</us_distribution><us_distribution> S.C.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Tenn.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Va.</us_distribution><us_distribution> W.Va.</us_distribution><discussion>Large-flowered, large-leaved plants of Rhododendron catawbiense from eastern North Carolina have been named forma insularis Coker.
