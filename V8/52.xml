Stems spreading, glabrous; spines at nodes 3, 10–20 mm; prickles on internodes dense.

Inflorescences pendent, solitary flowers or 2–4-flowered racemes, 2–7 cm (longer than leaves), axis pubescent, stipitate-glandular, flowers evenly spaced.  Pedicels not jointed, 8–12 mm, bristly and glandular; bracts broadly ovate, 4–8 mm, pubescent and stipitate-glandular.  Flowers: hypanthium red, very broadly conic, wider than long, 2–3 mm, glandular; sepals 4, connivent into tube, erect, red, strap-shaped, 6–10 mm; petals 4, connivent, erect, red, oblong, margins curled inward, 6–10 mm; nectary disc not prominent; stamens 2–4 times as long as petals; filaments linear, 12–40 mm, glabrous; anthers purple or red, oval, slightly sagittate, 2 mm, apex rounded; ovary densely stipitate-glandular; styles connate ± completely, 15–45 mm, glabrous.
