  <description>Shrubs, trees, or perennial herbs, often evergreen, usually glandular-punctate or with secretory resin canals appearing as dark dots or streaks on vegetative and/or floral parts (sometimes somewhat obscure in Samolus).  Leaves pseudoverticillate at ends of branches or alternate (some Samolus also with basal rosettes or reduced and scalelike leaves), simple; stipules absent; petiole present (often poorly differentiated in Samolus); blade margins entire or serrate.  Inflorescences terminal and/or axillary racemes or panicles.  Flowers bisexual [plants dioecious in Clavija], usually radially symmetric; perianth and androecium hypogynous (perigynous in Samolus); hypanthium usually absent (present in Samolus); sepals 5, distinct or connate proximally; petals 5, connate proximally, corolla usually campanulate or salverform [urceolate or subrotate]; stamens 5, antipetalous, epipetalous (free in some Samolus), distinct or closely aggregated (rarely connate); anthers dehiscent by longitudinal slits; staminodes 5 (sometimes absent in Samolus), antisepalous, epipetalous; pistils 1, 5+-carpellate; ovary superior to partly inferior (Samolus), 1-locular; placentation free-central with ± globose central axis; ovules anatropous, bitegmic, usually not embedded in placentae, tenuinucellate; styles 1; stigmas 1, truncate to capitate or lobed.  Fruits baccate or capsular, dehiscence loculicidal (Samolus).  Seeds 1–50+, light to dark brown, ± angular, globose or flattened; embryo dicotyledonous, straight; endosperm copious, starchless.</description>
  <discussion>Genera 7, species ca. 100 (3 genera, 6 species in the flora): widespread, mainly neotropical with Samolus cosmopolitan.</discussion>
  <discussion>Theophrastaceae are of little economic importance; some species of Jacquinia are used to make tropical fish poisons; fruits of the tropical Clavija Ruiz &amp; Pavón are edible.  All genera apparently are pollinated by insects (bees, flies, midges), with nectar and pollen as rewards (B. Ståhl and M. Källersjö 2004).</discussion>
  <discussion>Theophrastaceae are closely related to Myrsinaceae (often included by some in the latter) and Primulaceae, and are considered less advanced than either.  Samolus had been included in Primulaceae; the semi-inferior ovary, along with staminodal anatomy and mostly Southern Hemisphere distribution, made it an anomaly in that family.  M. Källersjö et al. (2000) have shown that Samolus is a sister taxon to Theophrastaceae and should be included in that family (as done here) or placed in a monotypic Samolaceae (B. Ståhl &amp; Källersjö 2004).  See further discussion under Primulaceae.</discussion>
