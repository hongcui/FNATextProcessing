  <description>Plants 10–25 cm, herbaceous; rhizomes thin, short; rosettes not clumped; vegetative parts heavily white-farinose.  Leaves not aromatic, indistinctly petiolate; petiole broadly winged; blade without deep reticulate veins abaxially, spatulate, 8–15 × 2 cm, thin, margins irregularly and sharply dentate to sinuate-dentate, apex obtuse to acute, surfaces glabrous.  Inflorescences (6–)10–25-flowered; involucral bracts plane, ± equal.  Pedicels erect, thin, 10–30 mm, length 2–5 times bracts, flexuous.  Flowers heterostylous; calyx green, campanulate, 3–5 mm; corolla lavender, tube 8–10 mm, length 2 times calyx, eglandular, limb 10–16 mm diam., lobes 5–8 mm, apex emarginate.  Capsules ellipsoid, length 1–2 times calyx.  Seeds without flanged edges, reticulate.  2n = 18.</description>

  <discussion>Primula specuicola has relatively large corollas, relatively long pedicels, and irregularly and sharply dentate to sinuate-dentate leaves with conspicuous farina.  It is a characteristic member of hanging-garden communities along the canyon walls of the Colorado River and its tributaries.  Plants with a more exserted capsule were given the name P. hunnewellii; this appears to be only a minor variant that does not warrant infraspecific recognition.</discussion>
