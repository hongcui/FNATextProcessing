Segregate species were named by Small based on widespread variation in leaf size, pedicel length, and fruit size.  The segregate species were recognized by R. B. Clark (1942); A. Cronquist (1945c) and later workers have submerged them because of intergradation across the range of S. tenax.</discussion></treatment>
