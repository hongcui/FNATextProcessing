  <description>Herbs acaulescent; caudex branched. Flowering stems 15–65 cm, glabrous or short
        stipitate-glandular. Leaves: petiole glabrous or short stipitate-glandular; blade cordate or
        orbiculate, shallowly 3–5-lobed, 1–7 cm, base cordate, lobes rounded, margins dentate, apex
        obtuse, surfaces glabrous or short stipitate-glandular. Inflorescences dense, interrupted.
        Flowers: hypanthium weakly bilaterally symmetric, free 1.2–1.9 mm, cream, broadly
        campanulate, 4–7 mm, short stipitate-glandular; sepals erect, often red-tipped, equal, 2 mm,
        apex rounded; petals erect, pink or white, spatulate to narrowly oblanceolate, (clawed),
        unlobed, 1–3 mm, margins entire; stamens included 1.5 mm; (filaments strongly incurved,
        shorter than and almost concealed by anthers); styles included to 1 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.1+ mm
        diam. Capsules ovoid, 5 mm, beaks divergent, not papillose. Seeds dark brown, ellipsoid, 0.6
        mm. 2n = 14, 28.</description>

  <discussion>Heuchera grossulariifolia includes both diploids and autotetraploids. K. A. Segraves
        and J. N. Thompson (1999) analyzed floral traits and flowering phenology in diploid and
        autotetraploid plants. Overall, plant size was greater in tetraploids than in diploids;
        flowers of tetraploids were larger (average hypanthium 6.5 mm) than those of diploids
        (average hypanthium 5.5 mm) and had a slightly different shape and phenology, but the
        diploids and tetraploids were not assigned taxonomic status in their study. Diploids and
        tetraploids were mixed in some populations, where characters intergraded (D. E. Soltis,
        pers. comm.). The autotetraploids have had two to seven independent origins from diploid
        progenitors, and do not represent a monophyletic lineage (Segraves and Thompson; Segraves et
        al. 1999).</discussion>
