  <description>Shrubs, to 3(–5) mm, often rhizomatous.  Stems: bark smooth to vertically furrowed, shredding; twigs with ferrugi-neous, multicellular, broad-rimmed, glandular-peltate scales.  Leaves persistent; petiole with ferruginous, broad-rimmed, glandular-peltate scales and unicellular-hairy; blade narrowly elliptic to elliptic or oval, sometimes obovate, (1–)5–8(–13) × (1–)2–3.5(–5.5) cm, thick, coriaceous, margins entire, plane to conspicuously revolute, with scattered, glandular-peltate scales, apex acute or acuminate or obtuse to rounded, surfaces with scattered, ferruginous, broad-rimmed, glandular-peltate scales abaxially, (scales ± deciduous adaxially).  Floral bud scales ferruginous-lepidote, sometimes also unicellular-hairy abaxially, margins unicellular-ciliate.  Inflorescences 5–10-flowered; bracts similar to bud scales.  Pedicels 5–15 mm, with ferruginous scales.  Flowers opening before or after development of leaves, erect to horizontal, fragrant; calyx lobes 0.5–2 mm, with ferruginous scales; corolla dark to very pale pink or white, upper lobe usually with greenish spots, campanulate to funnelform, 15–37 mm, with scattered, ferruginous, peltate scales on outer surface, petals connate (for 3/4+ their lengths), lobes 8–19 mm, tube gradually expanding into lobes, 8–22 mm; stamens 10, included to slightly exserted, ± unequal, 13–26 mm.  Capsules borne on erect pedicels, 6–14 × 2.9–5 mm, with ferruginous, peltate scales.  Seeds with short, blunt/truncate tails at each end; testa closely appressed.  2n = 26.</description>

  <discussion>Rhododendron minus is here circumscribed broadly, including R. carolinianum and R. chapmanii, and the latter is considered to be a distinct variety (W. H. Duncan and T. M. Pullen 1962).  Variety chapmanii is federally listed.  This species is often grown as an ornamental.</discussion>
  <discussion>Rhododendron minus and R. lapponicum are members of subg. Rhododendron, as indicated by their glandular-peltate scales; the subgenus is represented by hundreds of species in eastern and southern Asia (see J. Cullen 1980).</discussion>
