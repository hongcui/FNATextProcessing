  <discussion>Sarracenia rosea occurs on the coastal plain in southwestern Georgia (Lee, Randolph,
        Taylor, and Tift counties), the Florida panhandle (Gadsden County westward), southern
        Alabama, and southeastern Mississippi (George and Jackson counties). It differs from S.
        purpurea most obviously in its pink to nearly white petals and shorter scapes; the flowers
        of S. rosea are larger on average in most respects than those of S. purpurea. Vegetatively,
        S. rosea pitchers have thicker orifice rims that are more concave, longer setae on the hood,
        wider hoods, and, often, thinner pitcher walls than those of S. purpurea. Although there is
        some overlap of pitcher morphology between the two species, the distinctive features and the
        allopatric distributions warrant recognition of S. rosea as a separate species. A
        yellow-flowered variant has been named forma luteola (Hanrahan &amp; James M. Miller) Naczi,
        Case &amp; R. B. Case.</discussion>
  <discussion>Sarracenia rosea is attractive and easy to cultivate. It suffers from habitat loss
        throughout its range. Specimens apparently have not been collected from Georgia since
        1902.</discussion>
