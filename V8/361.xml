  <discussion>Subspecies crebrifolia is known only from Fish Canyon in the San Gabriel Mountains; it is considered fairly threatened (California Native Plant Society, http://cnps.web.aplus.net/cgi-bin/inv/inventory.cgi).</discussion>
  <discussion>Subspecies crebrifolia is remarkable for the large number of cauline leaves and the wide rosette leaves.  It is said to be quite distinct from subsp. pumila, which is more widespread at generally higher elevations in the same mountains; it differs further in its taller floral shoots and its later flowering.</discussion>
