Stems (slender to stout), 10–30 cm, glabrous.  Leaf blades oval to obovate or elliptic, 1.5–3.5 cm, base cuneate to rounded, margins serrate to ± crenate (teeth usually tipped with minute, glandular bristles), apex obtuse, surfaces glabrous.  Inflorescences axillary, drooping, secund racemes; peduncle reddish, 2–6 cm, sparsely hairy; bracts light green, oblanceolate, 2.5–3.5 mm, not exceeding sepals, glabrous.  Pedicels green, 4–8 mm, sparsely hairy; bracteoles 1–3, pink to reddish, narrowly oblanceolate to subulate, 1–2 mm, glabrous.  Flowers: sepals 5, connate ca. 1/2 their lengths, dark green, deltate, 1.5–2 mm, glabrous; petals 5, connate nearly their entire lengths, cream to light pink, 5–6 mm, glabrous, corolla urceolate, lobes 0.5 mm; filaments broadest proximally, tapering distally, minutely ciliate marginally; anthers with 2 bifurcating awns, dehiscent by subterminal pores proximal to awns.  Fruits white, 6–8 mm wide.</description><phenology>Flowering Jun–Aug; fruiting Sep–Oct</phenology><habitat>  Alpine heath and rocky soils on mountain slopes</habitat><elevation> 400–2900 m</elevation><us_distribution> Alaska</us_distribution><global_distribution> e Asia (Japan).</global_distribution><discussion>Gaultheria pyroloides is native on Honshu Island, Japan, and has been collected from a restricted location in Alaska, on the northeast corner of Kiska Island in the western Aleutians.</discussion></treatment>
