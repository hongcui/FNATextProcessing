  <discussion>A distinctive species with an uncertain origin, Arctostaphylos pacifica has often been relegated to hybrid status and ignored; it displays a number of unique characters not found in any other species.  It is found only at one location, San Bruno Mountain, the northern part of the Santa Cruz Mountains, San Mateo County.  The relationships of this species need additional study.</discussion>
