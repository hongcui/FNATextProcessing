Leaves basal and cauline, (basal usually withered at flowering, cauline reduced); petiole absent or present, flattened, 2–10[–20] mm; blade spatulate or elliptic to ovate, (2–)3(–5)-lobed apically or unlobed (lobes divergent), 2–10(–23) mm, thin, margins entire, stipitate-glandular, apex obtuse, surfaces ± purple-tipped stipitate-glandular to glabrate.  Inflorescences 2–10[–50]-flowered, loose thyrses or cymes, sometimes solitary flowers, 0.5–6 cm, purple-tipped stipitate-glandular; bracts sessile or short-petiolate.  Flowers: sepals erect, elliptic to ovate, margins ± stipitate-glandular, surfaces adaxially ± stipitate-glandular; petals white, not spotted, narrowly obovate to oblanceolate, 2.5–3 mm, longer than sepals; ovary 3/4 to completely inferior.  2n = 22 (Europe).</description><phenology>Flowering spring–early summer</phenology><habitat>  Moist rock crevices above beach, sandy or with humus, open sandy headlands, rock walls</habitat><elevation> 0–100[–1800] m</elevation><introduced> introduced</introduced><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><global_distribution> Europe</global_distribution><global_distribution> sw Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution> n Africa.</global_distribution><discussion>Most of the locations for Saxifraga tridactylites in the flora area are from around Victoria.</discussion></treatment>
