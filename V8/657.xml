  <description>Herbs, colonial, scapose, rhizomatous; rhizome slender, scale-leaved, slightly lignescent.  Stems erect, unbranched.  Leaves basal or rosulate at rhizome tips, 80–350 mm; petiole present; blade broadly ovate to orbiculate, margins finely dentate-serrate, apex obtuse to rounded, surfaces glabrous, subpalmately veined.  Scapes ebracteate, barely elongating after flowering.  Inflorescences compact racemes.  Flowers: sepals barely connate proximally; petals distinct nearly to base, corolla urceolate, 3.5–8 mm, lobes white, margins entire; anthers 1-locular, without basal spurs, transversely dehiscent; filaments and staminodes connate basally, forming coronalike tube adnate to corolla base, free distally; staminodes present.  x = 6.</description>

  <discussion>Prior to 1972, the single species of Galax was known as G. aphylla Linnaeus; the type of that name was shown by R. K. Brummitt (1972) to represent a species of Nemophila (Hydrophyllaceae).  Because Galax Linnaeus 1753 was based on the Nemophila type, the later name Galax Sims has been conserved.</discussion>
