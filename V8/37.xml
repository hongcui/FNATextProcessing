Stems decumbent, vining, or spreading, finely crisped-puberulent, sparsely subsessile-glandular; spines at nodes absent; prickles on internodes absent.  Leaves: petiole (1.5–)2.5–5.5(–8) cm, pubescent, stipitate-glandular; blade orbiculate, 5–7-lobed, cleft nearly 1/2 to midrib, (2.5–)4–12 cm, base deeply cordate, surfaces ± crisped-puberulent at least on veins, usually with some sessile, crystalline glands and more numerous, very short-stipitate, noncrystalline glands abaxially, glabrous adaxially, lobes ovate-triangular, margins shallowly to coarsely 2 times crenate-serrate, apex acute to obtuse.  Inflorescences erect or ascending, 6–8-flowered racemes, (2–)3–6(–8) cm, axis stipitate-glandular, flowers evenly spaced.  Pedicels jointed, (2.2–)3.2–12 mm, pubescent, red stipitate-glandular; bracts linear to lanceolate-subulate, 0.9–2.8(–3.6) mm, copiously crisped-puberulent, moderately reddish stipitate-glandular.  Flowers: hypanthium greenish white with pinkish tinge to red or purple, shallowly bowl-shaped, 0.6–1 mm, pubescent and stipitate-glandular abaxially, glabrous adaxially; sepals not overlapping, spreading, tips usually slightly recurved, greenish white to deep red or purplish, deltate-ovate to oblong-ovate, 2.4–4 mm; petals widely separated, erect, pinkish to reddish or purplish, greenish at apex, reniform or crescent-shaped, not conspicuously revolute or inrolled, 0.9–1.6 mm; nectary disc prominent, cream, reddish, or brownish, flat, 5-lobed, covering ovary; stamens nearly as long as to slightly longer than petals; filaments linear, 1–1.7 mm, glabrous; anthers cream, oval, 0.5–0.7 mm, apex blunt; ovary finely puberulent, prominently reddish stipitate-glandular, (glandular hairs to 0.5 mm); styles connate 1/3–2/3 their lengths, 1.4–1.8 mm, glabrous.  Berries palatable, purplish black, ovoid, (4–)5–10(–14) mm, pubescent, reddish purple stipitate-glandular.</description><phenology>Flowering Mar–Aug</phenology><habitat>  Moist woods, stream banks, forest edges, clearings, avalanche tracks</habitat><elevation> 0–2600 m</elevation><ca_distribution> Alta.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Yukon</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Alaska</us_distribution><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Colo.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Idaho</us_distribution><us_distribution> Mont.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.Mex.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Utah</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wash.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Asia (Siberia).</global_distribution><discussion>Ribes laxiflorum flowers have stamens with reddish filaments.</discussion></treatment>
