Leaves: petiole 1–5 cm, pubescent and stipitate-glandular; blade roundish, 3–5-lobed, cleft nearly 1/4 to midrib, 2–6 cm, base deeply cordate, surfaces stipitate-glandular, glands colorless, and tomentose abaxially, rough-hairy adaxially, (dark green and rugose), lobes deltate, margins biserrate, apex obtuse.  Inflorescences pendent, 10–25-flowered racemes, 3–5 cm, axis stipitate-glandular, flowers evenly spaced.

  <discussion>Ribes malvaceum occurs in the southern North Coast, South Coast, Transverse, and Peninsular ranges, and the Channel Islands.  It has also been reported from the Sierra Nevada in Tuolumne County.  Its thick, rugose leaves, which are white-tomentose abaxially and dark green adaxially, and glaucous, white-haired berries are striking.  Plants with dark green leaves occurring below 800 meters have been recognized as var. malvaceum, those with bright green leaves occurring up to 1500 meters as var. viridifolium.</discussion>
