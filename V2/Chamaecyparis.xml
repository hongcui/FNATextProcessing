Branchlets  terete or rhombic in cross section, in fan-shaped or pinnately flattened sprays.  Leaves  opposite in 4 ranks.  Adult leaves  usually appressed, lateral and facial pairs similar, closely overlapping, scalelike, free portion of long-shoot leaves to ca. 7 mm; abaxial glands present or absent, circular to linear.  Pollen cones  with 2--3 pairs of sporophylls, each sporophyll with 2--4 pollen sacs.  Seed cones  maturing and opening in 1--2 years, nearly globose, glaucous, 4--12 mm; scales persistent, 2--5(--6) pairs, valvate, peltate or basifixed, thick and woody, terminal pair often fused.  Seeds  1--4 per cone scale, lenticular, equally 2-winged; cotyledons 2--3.  x  = 11.</description><discussion>Two Japanese species are widely cultivated and may become established locally. Chamaecyparis obtusa (Siebold &amp; Zuccarini) Endlicher (hinoki-cypress) has obtuse, glandless leaves and seed cones ca. 10--12 mm broad; C . pisifera (Siebold &amp; Zuccarini) Endlicher (sawara-cypress) has acuminate, obscurely glandular leaves and seed cones 6--8 mm broad. Cultivated juvenile forms of several species have been referred to by the superfluous Retinospora Siebold &amp; Zuccarini.
