Bark  reddish brown, to ca. 35 cm thick, fibrous, ridged and furrowed.  Branches  downward sweeping to slightly ascending.  Leaves  1--30 mm, generally with stomates on both surfaces, the free portion to 30 mm, those on leaders, ascending branchlets, and fertile shoots divergent to strongly appressed, short-lanceolate to deltate, those on horizontally spreading to drooping branchlets mostly linear to linear-lanceolate, divergent and in 2 ranks, with 2 prominent, white abaxial stomatal bands.  Pollen cones  nearly globose to ovoid, 2--5 mm, borne singly on short terminal or axillary stalks.  Seed cones  1.3--3.5 cm.  Seeds  flattened, 3--6 mm, leathery. 2 n  = 66.</description><discussion>Redwood is the only naturally occurring hexaploid conifer. It is one of only a few vegetatively reproducing conifers (from stump sprouts) and possibly the tallest tree species known. Winter buds, though small, are evident.</discussion><discussion>Redwood, including Sequoia sempervirens and Sequoiadendron giganteum , is the state tree of California.</discussion><habitat>Coastal redwood forests</habitat><elevation> generally below 300 m, occasionally to 1000 m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution></treatment>
