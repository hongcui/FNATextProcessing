Leaves  monomorphic, clustered at stem apex, to 45 cm, bearing sori throughout year.  Petiole  highly variable in color, from uniformly dark purple to uniformly straw-colored, but mostly dark purple at base, grading to straw-colored at junction with blade, shorter than blade, base sparsely scaly.  Blade  ovate to elliptic, 2--3-pinnate, widest at or just below middle, apex short-attenuate; rachis and costae lacking gland-tipped hairs or bulblets; axils of pinnae with occasional multicellular, gland-tipped hairs.  Pinnae  usually perpendicular to rachis, not curving toward blade apex, margins dentate to crenate; proximal pinnae pinnate-pinnatifid to 2-pinnate, ± equilateral, basiscopic pinnules not enlarged; basal basiscopic pinnules mostly short-stalked, base truncate to obtuse, distal pinnae deltate to ovate.  Veins  directed into teeth and notches.  Indusia  cup-shaped to lanceolate, gland-tipped hairs absent.  Spores  spiny, usually averaging 33--41 µm. 2 n  = 84.</description><discussion>The finely dissected leaves, dark petioles, creeping stems, smaller spores, and terrestrial habit distinguish Cystopteris reevesiana from C . fragilis in the southwest. On rock and at high elevations, however, C . reevesiana can have stems with short internodes and leaves that are reduced in size and dissection (resembling C . fragilis ). In southern Colorado, the two species are sympatric in some areas and form triploid hybrids. Cystopteris reevesiana and C . bulbifera are the diploid progenitors of C . utahensis , which occasionally crosses with C . reevesiana to produce sterile triploid hybrids of intermediate morphology.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--fall</phenology><habitat> Terrestrial or on rock on variety of substrates</habitat><elevation> 1500--4000 m</elevation><us_distribution> Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Colo.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.Mex.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Tex.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Utah</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico.</global_distribution></treatment>
