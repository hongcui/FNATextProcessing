Leaves  arching or pendent, clustered, 30--45 cm.  Petiole  1--1.5 mm diam., glabrous, not glaucous.  Blade  lanceolate, pinnate, 20--24 × 8--10 cm, gradually reduced distally, glabrous; proximal pinnae 3(--4)-pinnate; rachis straight, glabrous, not glaucous.  Segment stalks  1--4 mm, with dark color ending abruptly at segment base.  Ultimate segments  fan-shaped, not quite as long as broad; base truncate or broadly cuneate; margins of fertile segments unlobed but very narrowly incised, sterile segments with margins lobed, denticulate;   apex rounded.  Indusia  transversely oblong, 3--10 mm,   glabrous.  Spores  mostly 40--50 µm diam. 2 n  = 60 .</description><discussion>Adiantum jordanii occasionally hybridizes with A . aleuticum where their ranges overlap in northern California, yielding the sterile hybrid Adiantum × tracyi C. C. Hall ex W. H. Wagner. Adiantum × tracyi , morphologically intermediate between its parental species, can be distinguished from A . jordanii by its broadly deltate leaf blade that tapers abruptly from the 4(--5)-pinnate base to a 1-pinnate apex. It is best separated from A . aleuticum by leaf blades with a strong rachis, and by ultimate blade segments that are less than twice as long as broad. Adiantum × tracyi shows 59 univalents at metaphase; its spores are irregular and misshapen (W. H. Wagner Jr. 1962).</discussion><phenology>Sporulating early spring--midsummer</phenology><habitat> Seasonally moist, shaded, rocky banks, canyons, and ravines</habitat><elevation> 0--1000 m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico in Baja California.</global_distribution></treatment>
