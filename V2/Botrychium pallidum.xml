Pinnae  to 5 pairs, ascending, approximate, distance between 1st and 2d pinnae not or slightly more than between 2d and 3d pairs, basal pinna pair approximately equal in size and cutting to adjacent pair, fan-shaped, strongly asymmetric, lobed to divided to tip, margins entire to irregularly crenate-dentate, largest pinnae often split into 2 unequal lobes, apex rounded, venation like ribs of fan, midrib absent.  Sporophores  1--2-pinnate, 1.5--4 times length of trophophore. 2 n =90.</description><discussion>A usually tiny plant, Botrychium pallidum is separable from dwarfed and narrow sun forms of B . minganense by the peculiar, often folded pinnae and pale green to whitish color. It has been found growing with B . campestre , B . echo , B . hesperium , B . lunaria , B . matricariifolium , B . minganense , and B . spathulatum . Its small size may cause it to be overlooked. This is one of four moonwort species that commonly produce dense clusters of minute, spheric gemmae at the root bases.</discussion><phenology>Leaves appearing in late spring and early summer</phenology><phenology> Sporadic, mainly in open fields but also in shaded places</phenology><conservation> of conservation concern</conservation><elevation> 0--2600 m</elevation><ca_distribution> Man.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Ont.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Que.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Sask.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Colo.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Maine</us_distribution><us_distribution> Mich.</us_distribution></treatment>
