Roots  arising at nodes, sometimes also on internodes.  Leaves  deciduous in temperate regions, heteromorphic, floating leaves averaging larger than land leaves.  Petiole  filiform, stiffly erect or procumbent in land leaves, lax in floating leaves.  Blade  palmately divided into 4 pinnae.  Pinnae  cuneate or obdeltate, pulvinate at base, frequently with numerous red or brown streaks abaxially in floating leaves.  Sporocarps  borne on branched or unbranched stalks at or near bases of petioles, aboveground (except in  Marsilea ancylopoda ), attached laterally to stalk apex (attached portion called raphe), tip of stalk often protruding as bump or tooth (proximal tooth), some species also with tooth distal to stalk apex (distal tooth); sporocarps densely to sparsely hairy, less so with age, dehiscing into 2 valves.</description><discussion>Species identification is virtually impossible without fertile material. The common name water-clover refers to the resemblance of the leaves to those of clover ( Trifolium spp., Fabaceae); pepperwort refers to the sporocarp, which approximates a peppercorn in size and shape.</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Ca. 45 species (6 in the flora with 5 native, 1 introduced):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> nearly worldwide.</global_distribution><author>David M.
