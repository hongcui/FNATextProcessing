Leaves  arching to stiffly erect, often densely clustered, 38--75(--90) cm.  Petiole  1--3 mm diam., glabrous, often glaucous.  Blade  fan-shaped to funnel-shaped, pseudopedate, 1-pinnate distally, 10--35 × 10--35(--45) cm, glabrous; proximal pinnae 2--7-pinnate; rachis straight, glabrous, often glaucous.  Segment stalks  (0.4--)0.6--1.5(--1.9) mm, dark color commonly entering into segment base.  Ultimate segments  long-triangular, ca. 2.5 times as long as broad; basiscopic margin oblique; acroscopic margin lobed, lobes separated by narrow (less than 1 mm) incisions; apex acute, usually entire.  False indusia  transversely oblong, mostly 2--5(--10) mm, glabrous.  Spores  mostly 45--58 µm diam. 2 n  = 116.</description><discussion>Adiantum viridimontanum , an allopolyploid from a sterile hybrid between A . pedatum and A . aleuticum , is known only from north central Vermont (C. A. Paris and M. D. Windham 1988). Additional populations may eventually be located on serpentine in southern Quebec.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--fall</phenology><habitat> Restricted to serpentine sites where it occurs in rock clefts, on talus slopes, and in well-developed serpentine soils</habitat><elevation> 200--800 m</elevation><us_distribution> Vt.</us_distribution></treatment>
