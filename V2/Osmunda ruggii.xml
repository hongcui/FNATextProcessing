  <discussion>Osmunda ruggii is a sterile, natural hybrid between O . claytoniana and O . regalis and one of only two interspecific hybrids known to occur in Osmundaceae. This nothospecies is known from two natural populations despite the widespread sympatry of parental stocks. The first reported population in Fairfield County, Connecticut, has not been relocated and is most likely extirpated. A single natural population is known to exist in Craig County, Virginia; it is estimated that its age could be greater than 1100 years.</discussion>
