Leaves  erect, 1--2.5 dm; bulblets absent.  Petiole  1/10--1/5 length of leaf, sparsely scaly; scales light brown, gradually diminishing in size distally.  Blade  linear, 1-pinnate-pinnatifid, base narrowed.  Pinnae  rhombic-ovate to short-falcate, proximal pinnae Â± triangular; pinnae overlapping, twisted somewhat out of plane of blade, 0.5--1.5 cm; base oblique, acroscopic auricle well developed; margins shallowly incised to merely dentate or serrulate, teeth spreading and spiny at tip; apex acute with subapical and apical teeth same size; microscales lanceolate with few projections, confined to costa, on abaxial surface only.  Indusia  entire.  Spores  dark brown. 2 n  = 164.</description><discussion>Polystichum kruckebergii is widely but sporadically distributed in small numbers in both the Sierra-Cascade and Rocky Mountain systems. Populations sometimes consist of only two or three dwarfed plants that are difficult to distinguish from P . scopulinum , with which they may occur. The spreading teeth of equal size at the pinna apex will usually distinguish this species. Polystichum kruckebergii is a tetraploid presumed to be of hybrid origin, with P . lonchitis and P . lemmonii as its diploid progenitors (W. H. Wagner Jr. 1973), although this hypothesis has not been confirmed. The hybrid with P . munitum has been found in Washington (P. S. Soltis et al. 1987) with both parents, and it is distinguished by intermediate morphology and abortive sporangia.</discussion><habitat>Rocks and cliffs in subalpine to alpine habitats</habitat><elevation> 1500--3200 m</elevation><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Idaho</us_distribution><us_distribution> Mont.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Nev.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Utah</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wash.</us_distribution></treatment>
