  <discussion>Pinus elliotti var. elliottii is the fastest growing of the southern yellow pines, much planted in the United States outside its range. It is very susceptible, however, to ice damage and fusiform gall inland. This is a naval stores pine, but it is considered increasingly important in plantations as a lumber and pulpwood pine. It is much planted in subtropical and warm temperate climates worldwide, particularly in Brazil.</discussion>
