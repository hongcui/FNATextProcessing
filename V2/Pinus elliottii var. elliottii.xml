It is very susceptible, however, to ice damage and fusiform gall inland. This is a naval stores pine, but it is considered increasingly important in plantations as a lumber and pulpwood pine. It is much planted in subtropical and warm temperate climates worldwide, particularly in Brazil.</discussion><habitat>Lowland to upland forests, old fields, and fine white sands, mostly long-hydroperiod soils</habitat><elevation> 0--150m</elevation><us_distribution> Ala.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Ga.</us_distribution><us_distribution> La.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Miss.</us_distribution><us_distribution> S.C.</us_distribution></treatment>
