Stems  short-creeping to erect, stolons absent.  Leaves  monomorphic, evergreen.  Petiole  3/4--3 times length of blade, base not swollen; vascular bundles more than 3, arranged in an arc, Â± round in cross section.  Blade  lanceolate to deltate or pentagonal, entire to 1-pinnate-pinnatifid [3-pinnate-pinnatifid], reduced distally to shallowly lobed or hastate apex, herbaceous to papery.  Pinnae  not articulate to rachis, segment margins entire to sinuate or shallowly lobed; proximal pinnae not or only slightly reduced, sessile to short-petiolulate, base equilateral or often inequilateral with prominent basiscopic lobe(s); costae adaxially rounded or shallowly grooved, grooves not continuous from rachis to costae; indument lacking or of multicellular hairs on costae abaxially, of multicellular hairs on costae adaxially.  Veins  reticulate, areoles with or without included veinlets.  Sori  in 1--several rows between midrib and margin, round; indusia peltate to round-reniform and with narrow sinus, persistent or caducous.  Spores  brownish, with inflated folds or wings.  x  = 40.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species ca. 200 (4 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> mostly tropical.</global_distribution><author>Robbin C.
