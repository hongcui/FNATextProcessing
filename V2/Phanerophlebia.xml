Stems  short-creeping to erect, stolons absent.  Leaves  monomorphic, evergreen.  Petiole  shorter than or ± equaling length of blade, base not swollen; vascular bundles more than 3, arranged in an arc, ± round in cross section.  Blade  ovate-lanceolate, 1-pinnate, with a ± similar apical pinna, papery.  Pinnae  not articulate to rachis, segment margins serrulate to spinulose; proximal pinnae largest or nearly so, short-petiolulate, ± equilateral or inequilateral with acroscopic lobe; costae adaxially grooved, grooves continuous from rachis to costae; indument of filiform scales on costae and veins abaxially, ± glabrous adaxially.  Veins  free [anastomosing], forked.  Sori  in 2 or more rows between midrib and margin, round; indusia persistent or caducous [absent].  Spores  brown, with inflated folds or wings. x = 41.</description><discussion>Phanerophlebia has sometimes been included in Cyrtomium , which it resembles superficially. As with that genus, Phanerophlebia might better be considered a subgenus of Polystichum , from which it is poorly differentiated morphologically. Elsewhere, some species have bicolored stem scales, netted venation, and/or lack indusia.</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Species 8 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution> n South America</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies in Hispaniola.</global_distribution><author>George Yatskievych</author><references heading="SELECTED REFERENCES"><reference>Maxon, W.
