  <discussion>Cystopteris utahensis is an allopolyploid derived from the diploid species C . bulbifera and C . reevesiana (C. H. Haufler and M. D. Windham 1991). Because C . utahensis shares one parent ( C . bulbifera ) with C . tennesseensis and because of morphologic similarities between C . reevesiana and C . protrusa (the second diploid parent of C . tennesseensis ), populations of C . utahensis were previously considered to have originated by long-distance dispersal from eastern populations of C . tennesseensis . Genetic studies using isozyme markers, however, indicated that C . utahensis was a distinct species and stimulated the discovery of morphologic criteria for distinguishing it from its eastern cousin. When combined with the geographic separation of the two tetraploids, the minor differences in indument features provide a means of circumscribing this genetically distinct species. Potential confusion in identifying C . utahensis arises because sterile triploid hybrids may form when it is sympatric with the more common diploid C . reevesiana .</discussion>
