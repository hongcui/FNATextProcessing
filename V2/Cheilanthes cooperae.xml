Leaves  clustered, 5--30 cm; vernation circinate.  Petiole  dark brown, flattened or slightly grooved distally on adaxial surface.  Blade  linear-oblong to lanceolate-ovate, 3-pinnate at base, 1.5--5 cm wide; rachis flattened or slightly grooved adaxially, lacking scales, with monomorphic pubescence.  Pinnae  not articulate, dark color of stalk continuing into pinna base, basal pair slightly smaller than adjacent pair, Â± equilateral, appearing hirsute adaxially.  Costae  green adaxially for most of length; abaxial scales absent.  Ultimate segments  linear-oblong to ovate, not beadlike, the largest 3--5 mm, abaxially and adaxially hirsute with long, strongly flattened hairs.  False indusia  marginal, weakly differentiated, 0.05--0.25 mm wide.  Sori  usually discontinuous, concentrated on apical and lateral lobes.  Sporangia  containing 64 spores. 2 n  = 60.</description><discussion>Although scattered throughout much of California, Cheilanthes cooperae is apparently rare and quite localized. It appears to be most closely related to C . viscida , from which it differs in lacking glandular pubescence. The ranges of the two species do not overlap, and they seem amply distinct.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating late spring--summer</phenology><habitat> Calcareous cliffs and ledges</habitat><habitat> usually on limestone</habitat><elevation> 100--700 m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution></treatment>
