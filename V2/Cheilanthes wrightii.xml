Leaves  clustered to somewhat scattered, 4--25 cm; vernation circinate.  Petiole  brown, grooved adaxially.  Blade  lanceolate to ovate-deltate, 2-pinnate-pinnatifid at base, 1--4 cm wide; rachis grooved adaxially, not scaly or pubescent.  Pinnae  not articulate, dark color of stalk continuing into pinna base, basal pair often slightly larger than adjacent pair, Â± equilateral, appearing glabrous adaxially.  Costae  green adaxially for most of length; abaxial scales absent.  Ultimate segments  oblong to linear, not beadlike, the largest 3--7 mm, abaxially and adaxially glabrous.  False indusia  marginal, slightly differentiated, 0.05--0.25 mm wide.  Sori  discontinuous, concentrated on interrupted lateral lobes.  Sporangia  containing 64 spores. 2 n  = 60.</description><discussion>The glabrous Cheilanthes wrightii is occasionally confused with C . alabamensis and certain species of Pellaea . Cheilanthes wrightii is easily separated from C . alabamensis by its glabrous rachis, which is grooved on the adaxial surface. It is distinguished from all local members of Pellaea by having both a grooved rachis and a thin, long-creeping stem.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--fall</phenology><habitat> Rocky slopes and ledges usually on igneous substrates</habitat><elevation> 300--2000 m</elevation><us_distribution> Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.Mex.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Tex.</us_distribution><global_distribution> n Mexico.</global_distribution></treatment>
