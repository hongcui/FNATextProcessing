Bark  brown, fibrous, exfoliating in thin strips, that of small branchlets (5--10 mm diam.) smooth, that of larger branchlets exfoliating in strips and plates.  Branches  spreading or ascending; branchlets erect, terete.  Leaves  green but sometimes appearing silver when glaucous, spreading, abaxial glands very elongate; adaxial surface with glaucous stomatal band; apex acute to obtuse, mucronate.  Seed cones  maturing in 2 years, of 2 distinct sizes, with straight peduncles, globose to ovoid, 6--13 mm, bluish black, glaucous, resinous to obscurely woody, with 2--3 seeds.  Seeds  4--5 mm. 2 n  = 22.</description><discussion>Juniperus communis is the most widespread juniper species, and many subspecies and varieties have been described. A major study, including chemical characters, is needed to clarify the taxonomy. J. D. A. Franco (1962) recognized four subspecies (here considered varieties); two of these---var. communis and var. hemisphaerica (J. Presl &amp; C. Presl) Parlatore---do not occur in the flora and a fifth, recognized here, was not treated by Franco.</discussion><discussion>The seed cones of Juniperus communis are used to flavor gin.</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Varieties 5 (3 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Eurasia.</global_distribution><key><key_statement><statement_id>1</statement_id><statement>Seed cones 9--13 mm, longer than leaves.</statement><determination>1a var. megistocarpa</determination></key_statement><key_statement><statement_id>1</statement_id><statement>Seed cones 6--9 mm, shorter than leaves.</statement><next_statement_id>2</next_statement_id></key_statement><key_statement><statement_id>2</statement_id><statement>Glaucous stomatal band on adaxial leaf surface 2 or more times as wide as each green marginal band; spreading to matlike shrubs; leaves linear-lanceolate, to 2 mm wide, apex acute to obtuse and mucronate.</statement><determination>1b var. montana</determination></key_statement><key_statement><statement_id>2</statement_id><statement>Glaucous stomatal band on adaxial leaf surface about as wide as each green marginal band; prostrate, low shrubs with ascending branchlet tips (occasionally spreading shrubs, rarely small trees); leaves linear, to 1.6 mm wide, apex acute and mucronate to acuminate.</statement><determination>1c var. depressa</determination></key_statement></key></treatment>
