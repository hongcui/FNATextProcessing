  <discussion>Cheilanthes yavapensis is an apogamous tetraploid, apparently formed by hybridization between C . lindheimeri and C . covillei (G. J. Gastony and M. D. Windham 1989). Although C . yavapensis has long been included within the concept of C . wootonii , the discovery that the similarities resulted from hybrid convergence rather than common ancestry requires that they be recognized as two distinct species. Unfortunately, the morphologic characteristics that separate these taxa are subtle, and careful study will be necessary to determine the proper dispositon of problematic specimens. In addition to the characteristics mentioned in the key, C . yavapensis is distinguished from C . wootonii by having larger spores, averaging more than 62 Âµm in diameter.</discussion>
