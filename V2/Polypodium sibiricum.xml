Leaves  to 25 cm.  Petiole  slender, to 1 mm diam.  Blade  oblong-linear, pinnatifid, usually widest at or near middle, to 4 cm wide, somewhat leathery; rachis sparsely scaly to glabrescent abaxially, glabrous adaxially; scales lanceolate-ovate, usually more than 6 cells wide.  Segments  oblong, less than 7 mm wide; margins entire to crenulate; apex rounded to broadly acute; midrib glabrous adaxially.  Venation  free.  Sori  midway between margin and midrib to nearly marginal, less than 3 mm diam., circular when immature.  Sporangiasters  present, less than 40 per sorus, heads normally without glandular hairs.  Spores  less than 52 µm, tuberculate with tubercles, surface projections more than 3 µm tall. 2 n  = 74.</description><discussion>This boreal diploid has traditionally been identified as Polypodium virginianum (T. M. C. Taylor 1970; F. A. Lang 1971), but recent investigations indicate that it is conspecific with the eastern Eurasian species P . sibiricum (C. H. Haufler and M. D. Windham 1991). The sporangiasters of P . sibiricum normally lack glands, but some collections have sporangiasters with a few glandular hairs. Although such collections could be misidentified, the spores of P . sibiricum are less than 52 µm and clearly distinguish it from P . virginianum , P . amorphum , and P . saximontanum . Hybridization occurs between P . sibiricum and P . virginianum where these species overlap in Canada, forming triploid individuals with misshapen spores (C. H. Haufler and Wang Z. R. 1991).</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--early fall</phenology><habitat> Cracks and ledges on rock outcrops</habitat><habitat> on a variety of substrates including granite and dolomite</habitat><elevation> 100--1000 m</elevation><global_distribution> Greenland</global_distribution><ca_distribution> Alta.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Man.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> N.W.T.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Ont.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Que.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Sask.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Yukon</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Alaska</us_distribution><global_distribution> n Asia.</global_distribution></treatment>
