Bark  brown to gray- or red-brown, platy to furrowed.  Lower branches  often descending, the upper spreading or ascending.  Twigs  slender, orange to red-brown, aging darker brown, rough.  Buds  narrowly to broadly ovoid, dark red-brown, to 1.2cm, slightly resinous.  Leaves  2 per fascicle, spreading or ascending, persisting 3--8 years, 2--8cm × 0.7--2(--3)mm, twisted, yellow-green to dark green, all surfaces with fine stomatal lines, margins finely serrulate, apex blunt to acute or narrowly acuminate; sheath 0.3--0.6(--1)cm, persistent.  Pollen cones  ellipsoid to cylindric, 5--15mm, orange-red.  Seed cones  maturing in 2 years or variably serotinous, variably persistent, spreading to reflexed, often curved, nearly symmetric or variably asymmetric, lanceoloid to ovoid before opening, broadly ovoid to nearly globose when open, 2--6cm, tan to pale red-brown, lustrous, nearly sessile or on stalks to 1cm; apophyses nearly rhombic, variously elongate, cross-keeled, often mammillate toward outer cone base and on inside above middle; umbo central, depressed-triangular, prickle barely elongate to stubby or slender and to 6mm.  Seeds  compressed, obovoid; body ca. 5mm, red-brown, mottled with black, or all black; wing 10--14mm. 2 n =24 (variety not indicated).</description><discussion>Pinus contorta is fire successional over most of its range and is characterized by prolific seeding and high seed viability in disturbed habitats, often resulting in extremely slow-growing, overly dense stands. Some authors consider it to consist of 4 races; these have been given various infraspecific ranks, but perhaps they are more conventionally treated as 3 varieties.</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Varieties 3:</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> only in the flora.</global_distribution><key><key_statement><statement_id>1</statement_id><statement>Leaves 2-7 cm × 0.7-0.9(-1.1) mm, dark green; mature trunk with bark evidently furrowed; seed cones strongly asymmetric, strongly recurved, persistent or variously serotinous.</statement><determination>33a var. contorta</determination></key_statement><key_statement><statement_id>1</statement_id><statement>Leaves (4-)5-8 cm × (0.7-)1-2(-3) mm, yellow-green; mature trunk with bark not evidently furrowed; seed cones asymmetric to nearly symmetric, recurved to spreading, variously serotinous or soon shed.</statement><next_statement_id>2</next_statement_id></key_statement><key_statement><statement_id>2</statement_id><statement>Seed cones asymmetric, recurved, variously serotinous, long-persistent; mid and lower apophyses mostly much domed; main branches mostly horizontally spreading, not ascending at tip.</statement><determination>33b var. latifolia</determination></key_statement><key_statement><statement_id>2</statement_id><statement>Seed cones nearly symmetric, mostly spreading, not serotinous, not persistent; mid and lower apophyses mostly shallowly domed; main branches ascending at tips.</statement><determination>33c var. murrayana</determination></key_statement></key></treatment>
