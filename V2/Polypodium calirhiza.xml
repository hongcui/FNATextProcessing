Leaves  to 70 cm.  Petiole  usually slender, to 3 mm diam.  Blade  lanceolate-ovate to oblong, pinnatifid, widest below middle or occasionally at base, to 16 cm wide, leathery to herbaceous; rachis sparsely scaly to glabrescent abaxially, puberulent adaxially; scales lanceolate-ovate, usually more than 3 cells wide.  Segments  linear-lanceolate to oblong, usually less than 15 mm wide; margins conspicuously serrate; apex obtuse to acute; midrib puberulent adaxially.  Venation  weakly to moderately anastomosing, some to many segments lacking areoles.  Sori  midway between margin and midrib or slightly closer to midrib, usually less than 4 mm diam., oval when immature.  Sporangiasters  absent.  Spores  more than 58 µm, verrucose, surface projections less than 3 µm. 2 n  = 148.</description><discussion>Although originally considered a cytotype of Polypodium californicum , P . calirhiza is an allotetraploid involving P . californicum and P . glycyrrhiza (S. A. Whitmore and A. R. Smith 1991) and therefore should be treated as a distinct species. Some individuals of P . calirhiza can be difficult to distinguish from the two parental species (see comments under P . californicum and P . glycyrrhiza ); most collections can be identified based on a combination of blade shape, venation pattern, spore size, and geographic distribution. Polypodium calirhiza hybridizes with P . glycyrrhiza to produce sterile triploid plants with misshapen spores.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating winter--summer</phenology><habitat> Cliffs and rocky slopes, sometimes epiphytic</habitat><habitat> on a variety of substrates but usually on granite or other igneous rocks</habitat><elevation> 0--1500 m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico.</global_distribution></treatment>
