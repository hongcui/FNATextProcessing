Leaves  mostly in 2s, sometimes in 3s on same shoot, resin canals per leaf 3--9, hypodermis (2--)3--4(--5) cell-layers thick.  Seed-cone base  mostly rounded when open.</description><discussion>The name Pinus caribaea Morelet has been applied in error to P . elliottii var. densa . This variety is best distinguished by its wood, which is heavier and harder than that of typical slash pine, and by its having a grass stage comparable to that of P . palustris . This variety is not used for naval stores as is the type variety; neither is it commercially planted.</discussion><habitat>Flatwoods, mostly over limestone</habitat><elevation> 0--10m</elevation><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution></treatment>
