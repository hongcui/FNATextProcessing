Stems  erect or creeping, branched; scales pale brown to black, concolored, elongate, margins entire.  Leaves  monomorphic, clustered or closely spaced, 1--20 dm.  Petiole  straw-colored, green, brownish red to purple black, longitudinally ridged, 2--3-grooved adaxially, scaly at base, glabrous or scaly distally, with 1 (less often 2 or more) vascular bundle.  Blade  oblong to lanceolate to deltate, 1--4-pinnate, herbaceous to leathery, abaxially and adaxially glabrous or sometimes pubescent or scaly, adaxially dull, not striate; rachis straight.  Ultimate segments  of blade sessile to short-stalked, linear to oblong-lanceolate, 1.5--8 mm wide; base truncate or narrowed to stalk, stalk when present green, not lustrous; margins plane or reflexed to form false indusia.  Veins  in leaves conspicuous, free (except in sori) and forking well above base of segment, or highly anastomosing.  False indusia  pale, scarious, covering sori.  Sporangia  intramarginal, sori usually continuous except at pinna or segment apex and sinuses, paraphyses present.  Spores  brown, trilete, tetrahedral, rugate and/or tuberculate, usually with prominent equatorial flange.  x  = 29.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species ca. 300 (5 species and 1 hybrid in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> worldwide</global_distribution><global_distribution> warm and tropical regions.</global_distribution><author>Clifton E.
