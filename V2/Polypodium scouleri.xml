Leaves  to 85 cm.  Petiole  stout, to 3 mm diam.  Blade  ovate-lanceolate, pinnatifid, usually widest just above base, to 27 cm wide, stiff and leathery; rachis sparsely scaly to glabrescent abaxially, glabrous adaxially; scales bicolored, ovate-lanceolate, much more than 6 cells wide.  Segments  oblong to linear, usually more than 12 mm wide; margins entire to crenulate; apex rounded to rarely broadly acute; midrib glabrous adaxially.  Venation  anastomosing, usually forming 1 row of areoles.  Sori  crowded against midrib, usually more than 3 mm diam., circular when immature.  Sporangiasters  absent.

Its venation pattern can be quite variable, however, and cannot be used as the sole feature distinguishing P . scouleri from P . californicum . Combining venation characteristics with others provided in the key distinguishes it clearly from its congeners in Polypodium . Some evidence suggests that P . scouleri hybridizes with P . californicum (S. A. Whitmore, unpubl.). I. Manton (1951) reported diploid and triploid cytotypes for P . scouleri , and variation in spore size suggests that the species may also include tetraploid populations.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating late fall--spring</phenology><habitat> Cracks and ledges on cliffs, occasionally epiphytic</habitat><habitat> on a variety of substrates but preferring volcanic substrates in warmer, drier climates, rarely far from ocean</habitat><elevation> 0--500 m</elevation><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wash.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico in Baja California.</global_distribution></treatment>
