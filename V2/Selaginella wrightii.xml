Stems  not readily fragmenting, prostrate, upperside and underside structurally different, irregularly forked, branches determinate, tips upturned.  Rhizophores  borne on upperside of stems, throughout stem length, 0.25--0.37 mm diam.  Leaves  dimorphic, arranged in 8 ranks, tightly appressed, ascending, green; abaxial ridges absent; apex with yellowish bristle 0.2--0.5 mm, becoming denticulate (by breaking off of bristle); bristle usually more persistent in underside leaves.  Underside leaves  narrowly linear-lanceolate to falcate (on marginal ranks), 3.5--4.5(--5) X 0.55--0.7 mm; base abruptly adnate or slightly decurrent, usually pubescent, sometimes glabrous; margins ciliate, cilia transparent, spreading, 0.12--0.26 mm.  Upperside leaves  linear-lanceolate, 3.3--3.85 X 0.6--0.75 mm; base abruptly adnate, pubescent; margins ciliate, cilia transparent, spreading, 0.12--0.26 mm.  Strobili  solitary, (0.7--)1.5--2(--2.6) cm; sporophylls lanceolate, abaxial ridges not prominent, base glabrous, margins ciliate, apex strongly tapering, bristle obscure.</description><discussion>Of other species in the flora, Selaginella wrightii seems to be allied to S . hansenii . The structural differentiation of the stem, adjacently different leaves, and upturned branch tips align the two species to the series Eremophilae . Selaginella wrightii is a calciphile, according to R. M. Tryon (1955).</discussion><habitat>On exposed or shaded limestone cliffs</habitat><conservation> of conservation concern</conservation><elevation> 800--2300 m</elevation><us_distribution> N.Mex.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Tex.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico.</global_distribution></treatment>
