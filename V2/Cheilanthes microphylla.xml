Leaves  usually scattered, 8--40 cm; vernation noncircinate.  Petiole  black, rounded adaxially.  Blade  lanceolate to linear-oblong, 2-pinnate-pinnatifid to 3-pinnate at base, 1.5--6 cm wide; rachis rounded adaxially, lacking scales, with dimorphic pubescence, abaxially sparsely hirsute, adaxially covered with tortuous, appressed hairs.  Pinnae  not articulate, dark color of stalk continuing into pinna base, basal pair often slightly larger than adjacent pair, Â± equilateral, appearing glabrous or sparsely pubescent adaxially.  Costae  black adaxially for most of length; abaxial scales absent.  Ultimate segments  narrowly elliptic to elongate-deltate, not beadlike, the largest 3--7 mm, abaxially and adaxially sparsely hirsute to glabrescent.  False indusia  marginal to obscurely inframarginal, somewhat differentiated, 0.1--0.4 mm wide.  Sori  somewhat discontinuous, often concentrated on interrupted lateral lobes.  Sporangia  containing 64 spores. 2 n  = 116.</description><discussion>In the flora, the primarily Caribbean Cheilanthes microphylla is known from a small number of localities on the Florida peninsula. This restricted distribution, combined with its smaller stems, mostly black costae, and 64-spored sporangia, helps to separate Cheilanthes microphylla from the closely related C . alabamensis .</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--fall</phenology><habitat> Calcareous rock outcrops and shell mounds</habitat><elevation> 0--100 m</elevation><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America.</global_distribution></treatment>
