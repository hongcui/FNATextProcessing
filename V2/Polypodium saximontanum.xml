Leaves  to 25 cm.  Petiole  slender, to 1.5 mm diam.  Blade  oblong to linear, pinnatifid, usually widest near middle, to 4 cm wide, somewhat leathery; rachis sparsely scaly to glabrescent abaxially, glabrous adaxially; scales lanceolate-ovate, usually more than 6 cells wide.  Segments  oblong, less than 12 mm wide; margins entire to crenulate; apex rounded to broadly acute; midrib glabrous adaxially.  Venation  free.  Sori  midway between margin and midrib to nearly marginal, less than 3 mm diam., circular when immature.  Sporangiasters  present, usually less than 40 per sorus, heads with a few glandular hairs or rarely without glands.  Spores  more than 58 µm, tuberculate, surface projections more than 3 µm tall. 2 n  = 148.</description><discussion>Polypodium saximontanum is an allotetraploid species whose progenitor diploid species are P . amorphum and P . sibiricum (M. D. Windham 1993). Prior to its recognition as a distinct species, collections of P . saximontanum were variously referred to P . montense F. A. Lang (= P . amorphum ), P . hesperium , and/or P . virginianum . In addition to its separate geographic range, P . saximontanum can be distinguished from P . virginianum by having narrower leaves and a reduced frequency of glandular hairs on its sporangiasters. Polypodium saximontanum also has a separate range from P . amorphum and has spores with large (greater than 3 µm tall) projections. Although P . saximontanum overlaps in range with P . hesperium , the latter species has no sporangiasters. Tetraploid hybrids of these two species have misshapen spores.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--fall</phenology><habitat> Cracks and ledges on rocks</habitat><habitat> apparently confined to granitic substrates</habitat><elevation> 1800--3000 m</elevation><us_distribution> Colo.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.Mex.</us_distribution><us_distribution> S.Dak.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wyo.</us_distribution></treatment>
