Leaves arching or sometimes pendent, closely spaced, 20--110 cm.  Petiole  1--3 mm diam., glabrous, occasionally glaucous. Blade trowel-shaped, pinnate, 12--60 × 12--60 cm, gradually reduced distally, glabrous; proximal pinnae 3-pinnate; rachis straight, glabrous, not glaucous.  Segment  stalks 1--5 mm, with dark color ending abruptly at segment base, terminating in cupulelike swelling at base of segment   (unlike any other species of  Adiantum  in the flora).  Ultimate segments  fan-shaped or rhombic, about as long as broad; base cuneate; apex rounded or acute, lobed, lobes separated by narrow incisions 0.5 mm wide.  Indusia  transversely oblong to crescent-shaped, 0.5--2 mm, glabrous.  Spores  mostly 40--58 µm diam. 2 n  = 60.</description><discussion>Adiantum tenerum is readily distinguished from other species in the flora by the ultimate segments conspicuously articulate to the stalks.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating throughout the year</phenology><habitat> Restricted to moist, shaded, limestone ledges, sink walls, and grottoes in the flora</habitat><elevation> 0--50 m</elevation><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><global_distribution> e</global_distribution><global_distribution>s Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America in Guatemala</global_distribution><global_distribution> Honduras</global_distribution><global_distribution> Nicaragua</global_distribution><global_distribution> Costa Rica</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America in Venezuela.</global_distribution></treatment>
