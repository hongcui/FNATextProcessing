Bark  purple-brown to dark brown, shallowly and narrowly fissured, with irregular, flat, loose-scaly plates, on upper sections of trunk nearly smooth.  Branches  ascending; twigs slender, red-brown.  Buds  ovoid to ovoid-cylindric, dark red-brown, aging darker, ca. 1.5cm, resinous; scale margins fringed, apex attenuate.  Leaves  3 per fascicle, spreading or ascending, persisting 4--5 years, (8--)9--15(--20)cm Ã— (1--)1.3--1.8mm, straight or slightly curved, twisted, yellow-green, all surfaces with fine stomatal lines, margins serrulate, apex abruptly conic-subulate; sheath (1--)1.5--2cm, base persistent.  Pollen cones  ellipsoid-cylindric, 10--15mm, orange-brown.  Seed cones  maturing in 2 years, serotinous, long-persistent, remaining closed for 20 years or more, or opening on burning, in whorls, hard and heavy, very asymmetric, lanceoloid before opening, ovoid-cylindric when open, 8--15cm, yellow- or pale red-brown, stalks to 1cm; apophyses toward outside base increasingly elongate, mammillate or raised-angled-conic, downcurved near base, scarcely raised on branchlet side, rhombic; umbo central, low-pyramidal, sharp, upcurved.  Seeds  compressed-oblique-obovoid; body ca. 6--7mm, nearly black; wing narrow, to 20mm. 2 n =24.</description><discussion>Pinus attenuata , mostly a chaparral species, bears cones at an early age. Its seed crops are heavy, and a hot fire permits the seeds to be released. It forms hybrids with P . muricata and P . radiata .</discussion><habitat>Fire successional on dry slopes and foothills of Sierra Nevada and the Cascade and Coast ranges</habitat><elevation> 300--1200m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico in Baja California.</global_distribution></treatment>
