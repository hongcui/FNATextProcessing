Sterile leaves  4--10 Ã— 1.4--2.5 cm.  Petiole  green to straw-colored, 1/2--3/4 length of leaf, ca. 0.3 mm wide, glabrous.  Blade  deltate, 2-pinnate, papery to somewhat leathery.  Pinnae  2--4 pairs, alternate to subopposite, segments oblanceolate, base cuneate, margins minutely denticulate, apex obtuse, sparsely pilose with stiff white hairs.  Fertile leaves  6--25 cm, much taller than sterile leaves.  Petiole  3/4--9/10 length of leaf.  Pinnae  compact, short-petiolulate, 1--6 mm.  Spores  with ridges anastomosing.</description><discussion>Anemia wrightii has been misidentified in Florida as A . cicutaria Kunze ex Sprengel (of Mexico in Yucatan; West Indies in the Bahamas, Cuba; and Central America in Guatemala), but that species has 3-pinnate sterile blades, abundant blade hairs, and fertile leaves that are more open with 4--5 pairs of long-petiolulate pinnae.</discussion><habitat>Rare around exposed to lightly shaded solution holes and limestone sinks</habitat><elevation> 0 m</elevation><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies in Bahamas</global_distribution><global_distribution> Cuba.</global_distribution></treatment>
