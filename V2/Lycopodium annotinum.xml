  <discussion>This widespread and common club-moss has been divided into various forms or varieties, some of which have been treated as species. Present evidence supports the hypothesis that these are environmentally induced forms, the most distinctive of which has been called Lycopodium annotinum var. alpestre C. Hartman, with leaves only 2.5--6 mm, very leathery, entire-margined, and appressed. Plants intermediate between this and L . annotinum var. annotinum are a form that has been called var. pungens (Bachelot de la Pylaie) Desvaux, an invalid name. Both are found in cold, bleak, northern or high elevation habitats. The species should be studied in detail to determine whether it contains any groups that should be recognized taxonomically.</discussion>
