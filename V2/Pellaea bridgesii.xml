Leaves  monomorphic, clustered on stem, 7--30 cm; croziers nearly glabrous.  Petiole  dark brown, lustrous, rounded adaxially, without prominent articulation lines.  Blade  linear, 1-pinnate, 1.5--4 cm wide; rachis brown throughout, straight, rounded adaxially, glabrous.  Pinnae  perpendicular to slightly ascending, usually not decurrent on rachis, simple and unlobed; costae absent.  Ultimate segments  broadly ovate to elliptic, 7--20 mm, leathery, glabrous; margins plane, not recurved, not covering abaxial surface, borders whitish, entire; apex obtuse to rounded.  Veins  of ultimate segments obscure.  Sporangia  sessile or subsessile, containing 64 spores, intermixed with abundant farina-producing glands. 2 n  = 58.</description><discussion>The morphology of Pellaea bridgesii is so distinctive that its sectional (and even generic) placement in Pellaea has long been a source of contention. W. H. Wagner Jr. et al. (1983) documented the existence of sterile diploid hybrids (called P . Ã— glaciogena ) between P . bridgesii and P . mucronata (see reticulogram), suggesting that P . bridgesii is most closely related to members of sect. Pellaea . In addition to the more obvious characters mentioned above, P . bridgesii is distinguished from other North American species (except P . ternifolia ) by its anastomosing veins.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--fall</phenology><habitat> Rocky slopes and cliffs, on granitic substrates</habitat><elevation> 1200--3600 m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Idaho</us_distribution><us_distribution> Nev.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution></treatment>
