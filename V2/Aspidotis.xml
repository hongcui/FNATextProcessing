Stems  ± compact, short-creeping, ascending at tip, branched; scales mostly dark brown, often with very narrow margin of lighter color, lanceolate, margins entire.  Leaves  monomorphic to somewhat dimorphic, crowded, 8--35 cm.  Petiole  usually dark reddish brown, with single groove adaxially, glabrous, with single vascular bundle.  Blade  ovate-triangular, deltate, or pentagonal, 3--4(--5)-pinnate, thick to thin, abaxially glabrous, adaxially lustrous, striate, glabrous; rachis straight.  Ultimate segments  of blades short-stalked or with base narrowed and decurrent onto costa or costule-bearing segments, linear to lanceolate, mostly 0.5--1.3 mm wide; stalks greenish, not darkened; fertile margins recurved.  Veins  of ultimate segments obscure, free, ± pinnate and unbranched.  False indusia  appearing inframarginal, scarious, whitish, broad, partly concealing sporangia.  Sporangia  in marginal, discrete or continuous sori on abaxial surface, containing 64 spores, lacking paraphyses and glands.  Spores  dark brown, tetrahedral-globose, trilete, reticulate, equatorial flange absent.  x  = 30.</description><discussion>D. B. Lellinger (1968) recognized Aspidotis as separate from Cheilanthes based on its elongate, distantly dentate segments with striate shining surface and on its broad, scarious indusia.</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Species 4 (3 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> 1 in Mexico.</global_distribution><habitat>Terrestrial, often at bases of boulders or in rock crevices, in dry to moist, montane areas, woodlands or chaparral, sometimes on ultramafic rocks.</habitat><author>Alan R.
