  <discussion>The pollen cones are usually borne at the base of alternate leaves, forming pendent axillary panicles; they occur less commonly singly or in racemes.</discussion>
  <discussion>Taxodium is variously treated as one to three species but treated here as one polymorphic species with two varieties in the flora. A third taxon tentatively accorded varietal rank--- Taxodium distichum (Linnaeus) Richard var. mexicanum Gordon (= Taxodium mucronatum Tenore)---and recognized by some authors as occurring within our range, appears to differ only in minor phenological characters. Whether or not populations from farther south in Mexico and Guatemala differ sufficiently for formal taxonomic recognition at any rank has yet to be determined.</discussion>
