Blade  lanceolate to deltate, 3--5-pinnate proximally, leathery, abaxially covered by dense white farina, adaxially glabrous or sparsely glandular; rachis rounded to slightly flattened adaxially.  Pinna costae  straight to slightly flexuous, branches not arising from prominent angles.  Ultimate segments  not articulate, dark color of stalks continuing into segment bases abaxially; segment margins recurved, often concealing sporangia; veins obscure adaxially.  Sporangia  submarginal, borne on distal 1/2 of secondary veins, containing 32 spores.</description><discussion>Populations of Argyrochosma limitanea represent two morphologically distinctive taxa treated here as subspecies. For the most part, these taxa have different geographic ranges, and genetic interaction between them is precluded because both are asexual triploids. Isozyme analyses indicate that the two subspecies have different polyploid origins, but evolutionary relationships (and proper taxonomic treatment) cannot be resolved until sexually reproducing (64-spored) progenitors are found.</discussion><key><key_statement><statement_id>1</statement_id><statement>Leaf blades broadly deltate-ovate, 4–5-pinnate, with proximal pinnae at least 1/2 as long as blades.</statement><determination>4a subsp. limitanea</determination></key_statement><key_statement><statement_id>1</statement_id><statement>Leaf blades lanceolate to oblong, 3–4-pinnate, with proximal pinnae 1/4–1/3 as long as blades.</statement><determination>4b subsp. mexicana</determination></key_statement></key></treatment>
