Stems  creeping, stolons absent.  Leaves  strongly dimorphic, fertile leaves usually shorter, greatly contracted, persistent 2--3 years, sterile leaves dying back in winter.  Petiole  of sterile leaf ca. 1--1.5 times length of blade, petiole of fertile leaf 2--6 times length of blade, bases swollen and persisting as trophopods over winter; vascular bundles 2, lateral, lunate in cross section.  Blade  of sterile leaf deltate, pinnatifid to pinnate-pinnatifid proximally, reduced and shallowly pinnatifid distally, herbaceous to papery, blade of fertile leaf linear-oblong, 2-pinnate, leathery.  Pinnae  not articulate to rachis, segment margins of sterile blades entire to sinuate or shallowly lobed, margins of fertile pinnules strongly revolute and forming hardened beadlike structures; proximal pinnae largest or nearly so, sessile or adnate, equilateral; costae adaxially flat; indument on both sides of linear to lanceolate scales and/or multicellular hairs on rachis and costae. Veins reticulate with areoles lacking included veinlets in sterile leaves, veins free in fertile leaves.  Sori  covered by strongly revolute margins of pinnae, Â± round; indusia vestigial, triangular, persistent but not easily seen in mature leaves.  Spores  greenish, with a few low folds and numerous, minute, echinate-cristate elements.  x  = 37.</description><discussion>Onoclea is one of several genera known to store starch grains in long-persistent petiole bases (trophopods) (W.
