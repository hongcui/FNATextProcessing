Stems  radially symmetric, underground (rhizomatous) and aerial, not readily fragmenting, irregularly forked; rhizomatous and aerial stems often with 1 branch arrested, budlike, tips straight; aerial stems mainly erect, seldom ascending, with budlike arrested branches throughout stem length.  Rhizophores  borne on upperside of stems, restricted to rhizomatous stems and lower 1/4 of aerial stems, 0.16--0.3 mm diam.  Leaves  dimorphic, not clearly ranked.  Rhizomatous stem leaves  loosely appressed, straight, scalelike.  Aerial stem leaves  appressed, ascending, green, linear-lanceolate to narrowly lanceolate, 1.8--2.1 X 0.49--0.56 mm; abaxial ridges prominent; base cuneate and decurrent to slightly rounded and adnate, glabrous; margins denticulate to very short-ciliate, cilia transparent, spreading to ascending toward apex, 0.02--0.04 mm; apex acute or seldom blunt.  Strobili  solitary, 0.5--1.2(--2.5) cm; sporophylls deltate-ovate to ovate-lanceolate, abaxial ridges prominent, base glabrous, margins denticulate, apex acute to obtuse.</description><discussion>In Texas Selaginella viridissima is known only from the Chisos Mountains.</discussion><habitat>Shaded cliffs, slopes, rock crevices, and igneous rock</habitat><conservation> of conservation concern</conservation><elevation> 1650--2300 m</elevation><us_distribution> Tex.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico in Coahuila.</global_distribution></treatment>
