Leaves  4--15 cm.  Petiole  black, equal to or somewhat longer than blade, rounded adaxially, bearing scattered glands and a few scales near base.  Blade  narrowly deltate-pentagonal, 3--4-pinnate, 1--2 times longer than wide, abaxially with conspicuous pale yellow farina, scales absent, adaxially glabrous to sparsely glandular; basal pinnae much larger than adjacent pair, strongly inequilateral, proximal basiscopic pinnules greatly enlarged.  Ultimate segments  sessile to subsessile, narrowly adnate to costae or free; segment margins strongly revolute, often concealing sporangia.  Sporangia  containing 32 spores.  n  = 2 n  = 90, apogamous.</description><discussion>Notholaena neglecta is closely related to N . californica and may have been involved in the origin of polyploids within that complex. Populations occurring in the flora are composed of apogamous triploids, but a sexually reproducing diploid cytotype has been found in Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico (M. D.
