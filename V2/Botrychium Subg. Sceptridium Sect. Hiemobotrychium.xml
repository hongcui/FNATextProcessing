Plants  over 6 cm.  Common stalk  with tracheidal idioblasts.  Trophophore  short-stalked and prostrate, arising from basal portion of common stalk near ground level; blades usually 2 per plant, appearing in late fall and dying in early spring, deltate, 2--3-pinnate, mostly 5--8 cm wide when mature, herbaceous.  Leaf primordia  with scattered hairs, hairs 0.6--1 mm.  Leaf sheath  closed.  Pinna  divisions reduced to tip.  First pinnule  on basal pinnae usually borne basiscopically.  Sporophores  long-stalked, arising from basal portion of common stalk near ground level, commonly absent without primordia; stalks and rachis broadly flattened, fleshy, to 1.4 mm wide.  x =45.</description><discussion>Tracheidal idioblasts in Botrychium sect. Hiemobotrychium are enormous, elongate, spindle-shaped cells with helical or annular thickenings and are scattered along the vascular strand. They are unique among ferns.</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Species 1:</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> endemic to se United States.</global_distribution></treatment>
