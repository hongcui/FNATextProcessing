Leaves  (only distal portion known) with bulblets present.  Blade  lanceolate, 2-pinnate, base probably narrowed.  Pinnae  narrowly lanceolate, ca. 2--7 cm, base truncate to oblique, acroscopic proximal pinnule enlarged, apex obtuse.  Pinnules  short-stalked, ovate-rhombic, acroscopic auricle Â± well developed, margins finely spiny-dentate; apex acuminate; microscales filiform, lacking projections, dense abaxially, sparse adaxially.  Indusia  entire.</description><discussion>Polystichum kwakiutlii is known only from the type specimen, collected at Alice Arm, British Columbia (whether referring to inlet or town is unknown). This species is presumed to be one of the diploid progenitors of P . andersonii . It should be sought among the boreal 2-pinnate polystichums, from which it can be distinguished by the presence of bulblets. Polystichum kwakiutlii differs from P . andersonii in its completely divided pinnae and entire indusia.</discussion></treatment>
