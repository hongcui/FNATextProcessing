Stems  prostrate, 0.5--1 cm.  Largest hairs  on upper leaf lobe near stem with 2 or more cells; broad pedicel cell often 1/2 or more height of hair, apical cell curved, with tip nearly parallel to leaf surface.  Megaspores  without raised angular bumps or pits, densely and uniformly covered with tangled filaments.</description><discussion>The sporophyte of Azolla caroliniana commonly survives throughout the year in temperate areas (with hard frosts and prolonged ice cover). It is the best adapted of all species for subsistence on mud. Azolla caroliniana is rarely collected with sporocarps.</discussion></treatment>
