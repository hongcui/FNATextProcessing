  <discussion>Selaginella × neomexicana is treated here as a hybrid, following R. M. Tryon (1955). Plants of this hybrid lack megaspores and megasporangia and have misshapen microsporangia. Several hypotheses for its origin have been advanced. It is clearly allied to S . rupincola , with which it shares white, long, spreading, marginal cilia on the leaves, hairs sometimes running along the ridges of the abaxial groove of the leaf, obscure rhizomatous underground stems, and buds mostly restricted to the base of aerial stems. Tryon (1955) suggested that the two presumed parents were S . rupincola and S . mutica , because S . × neomexicana has been found growing with S . mutica (usually var. limitanea ). The usually strongly keeled apex in S . × neomexicana is a feature of S . mutica , and the range of S . × neomexicana is within the range of the two presumed parents. Selaginella underwoodii might conceivably be the second parent instead; its range overlaps the ranges of the putative hybrid and S . rupincola . It is possible that S . × neomexicana may represent an asexual race of S . rupincola . More detailed studies are necessary to determine the reproductive biology and cytology of this presumed hybrid and to assess its relationships.</discussion>
