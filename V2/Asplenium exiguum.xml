Stems  erect or ascending, unbranched; scales black throughout, narrowly deltate, 2--3 × 0.2--0.3 mm, margins mostly with widely spaced, shallow teeth.  Leaves  monomorphic.  Petiole  dark reddish brown throughout, dull, 1--3 cm, 1/10--1/6 length of blade; indument of black filiform scales.  Blade  lanceolate, 2-pinnate to 2-pinnate-pinnatifid, 4--10 × 1--3 cm, thin, sparsely pubescent; base tapering; apex acute to acuminate, often bearing minute, scaly, proliferous bud.  Rachis  basally reddish brown, fading to green in distal 1/2 to 3/4, dull, sparsely pubescent and with a few filiform scales.  Pinnae  10--20 pairs, narrow, oblong; medial pinnae 5--12 × 4--7 mm; base acute to obtuse; margins coarsely incised; apex notched, bearing proliferous bud.  Veins  free, obscure.  Sori  1--4 pairs per pinna, on both basiscopic and acroscopic sides.  Spores  64 per sporangium. 2 n  = 72.</description><discussion>Asplenium exiguum has an interesting disjunct distribution, its range barely extending into the United States. Its vegetative propagation by buds scattered on the blade was reported by J. T.
