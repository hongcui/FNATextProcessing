    <description>Trees to 80m; trunk to 2.2m diam.; crown spirelike. Bark grayish brown, in age
        becoming thick and deeply furrowed (furrows and ridges about same width) and reddish brown
        (especially reddish when plates flake off). Branches diverging from trunk at right angles,
        stiff; twigs reddish brown, finely pubescent for several years. Buds hidden by leaves, tan,
        ovoid, small, not resinous, apex rounded; basal scales short, broad, equilaterally
        triangular, pubescent centrally, not resinous, margins entire to crenate, apex
        sharp-pointed. Leaves 1--3(--3.5)cm × 1.5--2mm, 1-ranked, flexible, proximal portion often
        appressed to twig for 2--3mm (best seen on abaxial surface of twig), distal portion
        divergent; cross section flat, with prominent raised midrib abaxially, with or without
        groove adaxially, or cross section 4-sided on fertile branches; odor pungent, faintly
        turpentinelike; abaxial surface with 2--4 glaucous bands, each band with (4--)6--7 stomatal
        rows; adaxial surface bluish green, with 0--2 glaucous bands, each band with 0--7 stomatal
        rows at midleaf; apex rounded to notched; leaves on fertile branches 4-sided with 4 bands of
        stomates below; resin canals small, near margins and abaxial epidermal layer. Pollen cones
        at pollination ± purple, ± red, or reddish brown. Seed cones oblong-cylindric, 10--15 ×
        5--6.5cm, green, red, or purple, overlaid with green bracts, at maturity brown (bracts
        light-colored and scales dark), sessile, apex rounded; scales ca. 2.5 × 3cm, pubescent;
        bracts exserted and reflexed over scales. Seeds 12 × 6mm, body reddish brown; wing slightly
        longer than body, light brown to straw; cotyledons (4--)5--6(--7). 2 n =24.</description>
