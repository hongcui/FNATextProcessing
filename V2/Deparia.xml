Stems creeping, stolons absent.  Leaves  monomorphic, dying back in winter. Petiole 1/3--2/3 length of blade, base swollen and persisting as trophopod over winter or not; vascular bundles 2, lateral, lunate in cross section.  Blade  elliptic to ovate-lanceolate, 1-pinnate-pinnatifid [pinnatifid to 3-pinnate-pinnatifid], gradually reduced distally to pinnatifid apex, herbaceous.  Pinnae  not articulate to rachis, segment margins entire, crenulate, or serrate; proximal pinnae (several pairs) reduced or not, sessile, equilateral; costae adaxially shallowly grooved, grooves not continuous with that of rachis; indument on rachis and costae (both sides) of multicellular hairs.  Veins  free, simple or forked.  Sori  on veins, elongate, Â± straight, or hooked at distal end; indusia linear, laterally attached, persistent.  Spores  brownish, broadly winged.  x  = 40.</description><discussion>Petiole bases are swollen and toothed in sect. Lunathyrium (Koidzumi) M. Kato but not or only slightly thickened and without teeth in sects. Athyriopsis (Ching) M. Kato, Deparia , and Dryoathyrium (Ching) M. Kato.</discussion><discussion>Two American species, one native and the other introduced, are usually placed in Athyrium or Diplazium . The genus Deparia , however, including these two species, is sufficiently distinct to warrant generic separation because of its nondecurrent costal grooves and the presence of multicellular hairs on blades (M. Kato 1984).</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Species ca. 50 (2 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> e Asia</global_distribution><global_distribution> se and tropical Africa including Madagascar</global_distribution><global_distribution> Pacific Islands</global_distribution><global_distribution> Australia.</global_distribution><author>Masahiro Kato</author><references heading="SELECTED REFERENCES"><reference>Kato, M. 1984.
