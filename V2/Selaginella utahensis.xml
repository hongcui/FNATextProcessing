  <discussion>Selaginella utahensis is very closely related to, and can be easily confused with, S . leucobryoides . The leaf apex of S . utahensis is sometimes blunt, smooth, and rather opaque, or with a very short bristle or mucro, and its leaves are in defined alternate pseudowhorls of four. In contrast, S . leucobryoides has obvious whitish, puberulent</discussion>
  <discussion>(rough) bristles, and the leaves are not in well-defined alternate pseudowhorls. The two species overlap in range and expressions of morphologic characters. They are treated here as separate species until additional studies can be carried out to determine whether or not they represent ecological variations of the same species or distinct species.</discussion>
