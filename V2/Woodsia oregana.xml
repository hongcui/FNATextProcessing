  <discussion>The variability and promiscuity of Woodsia oregana have been major sources of taxonomic difficulties in Woodsia , and more work will be necessary before relationships in this complex are fully resolved. As defined here, W . oregana comprises two subspecies that are chromosomally and biochemically distinct. In addition, the two taxa are nearly allopatric, with the diploid (subsp. oregana ) confined to the Pacific Northwest and the tetraploid (subsp. cathcartiana ) extending from the southwestern United States to eastern Canada. Isozyme studies indicate that subsp. cathcartiana is not an autotetraploid derived from known diploid populations of subsp. oregana , as was hypothesized by D. F. M. Brown (1964), and it may be more appropriate to recognize these taxa as distinct species. The morphologic features that distinguish these subspecies are very subtle, however, and they are associated primarily with differences in chromosome number. Until further systematic analyses are undertaken, these cytotypes should be maintained as subspecies of W . oregana .</discussion>
