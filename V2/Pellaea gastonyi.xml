Leaves  somewhat dimorphic, sterile leaves shorter than fertile leaves, clustered on stem, 8--25 cm; croziers villous.  Petiole  reddish purple to dark brown, lustrous, rounded adaxially, without prominent articulation lines.  Blade  elongate-deltate to lanceolate, 2-pinnate proximally, 3--6 cm wide; rachis purple or brown throughout, straight, rounded adaxially, sparsely villous with long, divergent hairs.  Pinnae  ascending or perpendicular to rachis, not decurrent on rachis or obscurely so, usually with 3--7 ultimate segments; costae straight, 2--30 mm, usually shorter than ultimate segments.  Ultimate segments  oblong-lanceolate, 7--30 mm, leathery, sparsely villous abaxially near midrib; margins usually recurved on fertile segments, covering less than 1/2 abaxial surface, borders whitish, crenulate; apex obtuse to slightly mucronate.  Veins  of ultimate segments obscure.  Sporangia  long-stalked, containing 32 spores, not intermixed with farina-producing glands.</description><discussion>Pellaea gastonyi is an apogamous tetraploid that has originated through repeated hybridization between P . atropurpurea and P . glabella . Isozyme studies (G. J. Gastony 1988) indicate that P . glabella subsp. missouriensis was the diploid parent of plants found in Missouri, whereas diploid P . glabella subsp. occidentalis was involved in the origin of P . gastonyi populations occurring in western North America. Pellaea gastonyi is most often confused with P . atropurpurea , from which it differs in having sparsely villous rachises, smaller ultimate segments, and spores averaging more than 62 Âµm in diameter.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--fall</phenology><habitat> Calcareous cliffs and ledges, usually on limestone</habitat><elevation> 100--1500 m</elevation><ca_distribution> Alta.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Sask.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Mo.</us_distribution><us_distribution> S.Dak.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wyo.</us_distribution></treatment>
