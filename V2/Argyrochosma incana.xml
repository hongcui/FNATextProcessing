Petiole  black, 0.75--2 mm diam.  Blade  ovate, 3--4-pinnate proximally, leathery, abaxially covered by dense, white farina, adaxially glabrous; rachis rounded to slightly flattened adaxially.  Pinna costae  straight or nearly so, branches not arising from prominent angles.  Ultimate segments  articulate, dark color of stalks stopping abruptly at bases; segment margins plane, never concealing sporangia; veins obscure adaxially.  Sporangia  following secondary veins for most of length, containing 64 spores. 2 n  = 54.</description><discussion>Argyrochosma incana has been collected at about 10 localities in the flora area, all within 50 km of the Mexican border. Most herbarium specimens were previously identified as A . limitanea , which is easily distinguished from A . incana by the characteristics given in the key. In addition, all known plants of A . limitanea have 32 spores per sporangium; those of A . incana have 64. Although A . incana shows considerable morphologic and biochemical diversity in Mexico, populations in the United States are relatively uniform.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--fall</phenology><habitat> Sheltered cracks and ledges on canyon walls</habitat><habitat> restricted to rocks of volcanic origin in the flora</habitat><elevation> 1200--1700 m</elevation><us_distribution> Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.Mex.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies in Hispaniola</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America in Guatemala.</global_distribution></treatment>
