Stems  erect, unbranched; scales brown throughout, narrowly lanceolate, 5--10 × 1--1.5 mm, margins entire.  Leaves  monomorphic.  Petiole  vestigial.

Rachis  green throughout, dull, glabrous.  Veins  numerous, free, mostly immersed.  Sori  parallel to each other, nearly perpendicular to midrib.  Spores  64 per sporangium. 2 n  = 144.</description><discussion>Asplenium serratum is found rarely in southern peninsular Florida, where it is at the extreme edge of its tropical American range. This large simple-leaved spleenwort is called "American bird's-nest fern" because of its superficial resemblance to the Old World A . nidus Linnaeus, which is regularly grown in temperate conservatories. Asplenium serratum is unusual in having roots with abundant, matted hairs rather than scattered hairs as found in other species.</discussion><habitat>Rotten logs and stumps</habitat><elevation> 0--50 m</elevation><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution></treatment>
