Leaves  monomorphic, clustered at stem apex, to 45 cm, nearly all bearing sori.  Petiole  usually dark at base, grading to straw-colored distally, shorter than blade, sparsely scaly at base.  Blade  ovate to narrowly ovate, 2-pinnate to 2-pinnate-pinnatifid, widest above base, apex short-attenuate; rachis and costae usually sparsely invested with unicellular, gland-tipped hairs, occasionally with misshapen bulblets; axils of pinnae with occasional multicellular, gland-tipped hairs.  Pinnae  typically perpendicular to rachis, not curving toward blade apex, margins serrate; proximal pinnae pinnate-pinnatifid to pinnatifid, ± equilateral, basiscopic pinnules not enlarged, basal basiscopic pinnules sessile to short-stalked, base truncate to obtuse; distal pinnae ovate to oblong.  Veins  directed into teeth and notches.  Indusia  cup-shaped, apex truncate, typically sparsely invested with unicellular, gland-tipped hairs.  Spores  spiny, usually 49--60 µm. 2 n  = 252.</description><discussion>Cystopteris laurentiana is a sexual allohexaploid species with C . bulbifera as the diploid parent and C . fragilis as the tetraploid. Cystopteris laurentiana was previously thought to be common only in the Great Lakes region (R. F. Blasdell 1963); it is now known to occur frequently in the Driftless Area of the Midwest. Because C . laurentiana can be difficult to distinguish from C . fragilis , specimens with ovate leaves having unusually large spores and growing on moist cliffs should be checked carefully for occasional glandular hairs, the distinguishing feature of C . laurentiana . Sterile pentaploid hybrids between C . laurentiana and C . fragilis have been discovered where the two species are sympatric.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--fall</phenology><habitat> Cracks and ledges on cliffs, often on calcareous substrates</habitat><elevation> 0--1000 m</elevation><ca_distribution> N.B.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Nfld.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> N.S.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Ont.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> Que.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Conn.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Ill.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Iowa</us_distribution><us_distribution> Mass.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Mich.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Minn.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Pa.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Vt.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wis.</us_distribution></treatment>
