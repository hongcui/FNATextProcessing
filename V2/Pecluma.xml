Stems  short-creeping, unbranched, 4--8 mm diam., not whitish pruinose; scales concolored, ovate to linear-lanceolate, not clathrate, glabrous or pubescent, margins entire.  Leaves  monomorphic, crowded, narrowed toward tip, to 90 cm.  Petiole  dark brown to black, round in cross section except for narrow lateral ridge decurrent from base of blade.  Blade  narrowly oblong to linear, usually pectinate, with more than (20--)25 pairs of segments, not glaucous, pubescent, scales absent or on midrib only; rachis scaly and/or pubescent or glabrous abaxially, pubescent adaxially, scales basally attached and linear to cordate.  Segments  usually linear, 1.5--5(--8) mm wide, adnate to costa, closely spaced, margins entire, apex acute.  Veins  1--2-forked [simple], occasionally anastomosing.  Sori  terminal on veins, round; indument of branched glandular hairs.  Spores  tuberculate.  x  = 37.</description><discussion>Within Polypodiaceae, Pecluma is distinctive in its short-creeping stems, pectinate blades (usually with more than 30 pairs of segments), and ungrooved, adaxially pubescent rachises.</discussion><discussion>Many species of Pecluma are well adapted to dry seasons. As the leaves dry out, the segments curl inwardly, presumably retarding moisture loss. After rains, the segments uncurl, apparently undamaged by the period of dryness.</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Species ca. 30 (3 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America.</global_distribution><author>A.
