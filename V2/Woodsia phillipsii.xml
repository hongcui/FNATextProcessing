  <discussion>Woodsia phillipsii traditionally has been identified as W . mexicana . It differs from typical W . mexicana , however, in having completely filamentous indusial segments, multicellular (often filamentous) translucent projections on the pinnule margins, a greater number of pinnules per pinna, and a diploid chromosome number. Woodsia phillipsii is the only diploid species currently recognized in the W . mexicana complex, and it was probably involved in the hybrid origins of both W . mexicana and W . neomexicana . Some individuals of the latter species are difficult to distinguish from W . phillipsii (see comments under W . neomexicana ), and the two taxa occasionally hybridize to produce sterile triploids of intermediate morphology. Woodsia phillipsii is also known to hybridize with W . plummerae (see comments under that species) and W . cochisensis .</discussion>
