Stems  long-creeping, threadlike, bearing scattered leaves, covered with dark hairs of 2 types, 2-celled glandular hairs and elongate rhizoidlike hairs; roots absent.  Leaves  round to oblanceolate, simple or irregularly lobed at apices, 5--10 Ã— 2--9 mm, with dark stellate hairs on margin and 2-celled glandular hairs on petioles and veins; petioles shorter than blades.  Venation  repeatedly forking from the base with few unconnected false veins.  Soral involucres  1--6 per blade, terminal on blades, long-conic, flaring at mouth; involucre lips inconspicuously dark edged.  Gametophytes  composed entirely of branched filaments.  Gemmae  composed of short filaments of undifferentiated cells. 2 n  = 68.</description><discussion>Some early authors listed Trichomanes sphenoides Kunze as occurring in Florida. J. G. Wessels Boer (1962), however, reduced T . sphenoides to T . punctatum subsp. sphenoides , which occurs in the Greater Antilles, Central America, and western South America, and considered all the Florida material to be the endemic T . punctatum subsp. floridanum .</discussion><habitat>On rock in limestone sinks, rarely epiphytic on trunks and roots of trees in limestone sinks</habitat><elevation> 0--100 m</elevation><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution></treatment>
