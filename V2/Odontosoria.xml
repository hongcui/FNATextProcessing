Stems  creeping on substrate surface, mostly short; hairs brown, jointed (grading into long, narrow scales with uniseriate tip), not clathrate.  Leaves  closely spaced to quite distant, erect to arching, narrowly oblong [triangular, ovate, to irregularly shaped], 10--50 cm [to 6 m].  Petiole  glabrous or with a few basal scales, stem buds absent, vascular bundles 1.  Blade  3--4-pinnate [2--5-pinnate, sometimes scandent or climbing], ± glabrous [some species with spines on petiole, midrib, or costae]; rachises without prickles; nectaries absent.  Segments  nearly dichotomously divided; ultimate segments linear to cuneate, margins entire or bifid.  Veins  free, simple or forked.  Sori  terminal near blade margin on single vein or on commissure joining 2--8 veins, ± spheric to transversely elongate, indusia attached at base and sides, opening toward margin.  Spores  tetrahedral to nearly globose, or oblong, trilete or monolete, smooth or granulate.  x  = 38, 47.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 22 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> mostly tropical.</global_distribution><author>Karl U.
