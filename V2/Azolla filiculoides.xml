Stems  prostrate when immature, 1--3 cm, internodes elongate to 5 mm, becoming nearly erect to 5 cm or more when mature and crowded.  Hairs  on upper leaf lobes strictly unicellular.  Megaspores  warty with raised angular bumps, each with a tangle of filaments.</description><discussion>Azolla filiculoides is cold tolerant, surviving even in fragmented parts under thin ice. It usually reaches a climax population in late spring, becomes fertile, collapses, and is replaced by other more heat-tolerant aquatics such as Lemna spp. Hybrids between this species (male) and A . microphylla Kaulfuss (female), a species of Central America, South America, and the West Indies, have been reported (Do V. C. et al. 1989). V. M. Bates and E. T. Browne (1981) reported A . filiculoides from Georgia, far removed from its main range in western North America. The most likely explanation is that the plants represent escapes from horticulture.</discussion><references heading="SELECTED REFERENCES"><reference>Bates, V. M. and E. T. Browne. 1981.
