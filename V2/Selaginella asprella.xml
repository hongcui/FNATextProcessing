Stems  decumbent to short-creeping, dry stem readily fragmenting, irregularly forking, without budlike arrested branches, tips straight; main stem upperside and underside structurally slightly different, inconspicuously indeterminate, lateral branches radially symmetric, determinate or not, often strongly ascending on cushionlike mats, 1--2-forked.  Rhizophores  borne on upperside of stems, throughout stem length, 0.2--0.4 mm diam.  Leaves  monomorphic, in alternate pseudowhorls of 4, tightly appressed, ascending, green, narrowly triangular-lanceolate to linear-lanceolate, (2--)2.5--4 X 0.45--0.7(--0.8) mm (smaller on young buds); abaxial ridges present; base cuneate and decurrent or sometimes rounded and adnate on young buds, pubescent (hairs often covering 1/4 of leaf length abaxially); margins ciliate, cilia transparent to whitish, spreading, 0.7--0.15 mm; apex keeled, attenuate or obtuse, bristled; bristle white or transparent, puberulent, 0.5--1.4 mm.  Strobili  solitary, 0.4--1.5(--2) cm; sporophylls lanceolate and strongly tapering to apex or deltate-ovate to ovate-lanceolate, abaxial ridges moderately defined, base pubescent or glabrous, margins short-ciliate to dentate, apex keeled or plane, bristled.</description><discussion>Selaginella asprella may be confused with S . leucobryoides particularly because of its readily fragmenting stems.</discussion><habitat>Limestone ridges, dry rocky slopes, igneous rock, exposed cliffs or gravelly soil</habitat><conservation> of conservation concern</conservation><elevation> 900--2700 m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico in Baja California.</global_distribution></treatment>
