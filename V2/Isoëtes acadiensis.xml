Isoëtes acadiensis can be distinguished from I. tuckermanii by its megaspore texture. Where these two taxa grow together, plants bearing megaspores with intermediate patterns occur.  In Atlantic Canada, I. acadiensis typically occupies shallower water than I. tuckermanii.&#xD;

Isoëtes acadiensis hybridizes with I. lacustris.</habitat></treatment>
