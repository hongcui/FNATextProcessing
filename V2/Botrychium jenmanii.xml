Pinnae  to 5 pairs, well separated, slightly descending to ascending, distance between 1st and 2d pinnae not or slightly more than between 2d and 3d pairs; basal pinnae remotely alternate and long-stalked (basal pinnae in all other botrychiums are opposite to subopposite and short-stalked), divided to tip.  Pinnules  ovate to fan-shaped, margins uniformly denticulate, apex rounded, venation like ribs of fan with short midrib.  Sporophores  2-pinnate, 1.2--2.5 times length of trophophore. 2 n =180.</description><discussion>Botrychium jenmanii occurs in a variety of habitats. In hardwoods and especially pine woods, it is associated with B . biternatum ; in open grassy places and lawns it is found with B . lunarioides . In many ways, B . jenmanii is intermediate between B . biternatum and B . lunarioides , and it is possibly their allopolyploid derivative (W. H. Wagner Jr. 1968). It is the only tetraploid among New World members of subg. Sceptidrium .</discussion><phenology>Leaves green over winter, arising at variable times during last half of summer, meiosis as late as September</phenology><habitat> Woods and grassy places</habitat><elevation> 50--500 m</elevation><us_distribution> Ala.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Ga.</us_distribution><us_distribution> La.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Miss.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.C.</us_distribution><us_distribution> S.C.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Tenn.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Va.</us_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies in Greater Antilles.</global_distribution></treatment>
