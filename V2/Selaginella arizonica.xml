Stems  not readily fragmenting, prostrate, upperside and underside structurally different, irregularly forked, branches determinate, tips upturned in extremely dry conditions.  Rhizophores  borne on upperside of stem throughout, 0.25--0.3 mm diam.  Leaves  conspicuously dimorphic, in 8 ranks, tightly appressed to ascending, green; abaxial ridges present; apex with transparent to opaque, flattened bristle 0.1--0.3 mm, sometimes becoming acute (by breaking off of bristle).  Underside leaves  lanceolate, 2--2.5 X 0.5--0.6 mm; base decurrent, glabrous; margins ciliate, cilia transparent to opaque, spreading or ascending, 0.06--0.13 mm.  Upperside leaves  linear-lanceolate to slightly falcate (on marginal ranks), 1.9--2.25 X 0.4--0.55 mm; base abruptly adnate, pubescent or glabrous; margins ciliate, cilia transparent to opaque, spreading, 0.06--0.15 mm.  Strobili  solitary, 5--10 mm; sporophylls ovate-deltate, abaxial ridges not prominent, base glabrous, margins short-ciliate to denticulate, apex acute.</description><discussion>Selaginella arizonica can be further distinguished from the similar S . peruviana by its broad, thin underside leaves. In S . peruviana the underside leaves are narrow and fleshy.</discussion><habitat>In rock crevices or on gravel, on sandstone, igneous, or rarely limestone substrates</habitat><elevation> 600--2000 m</elevation><us_distribution> Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Tex.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico in Baja California</global_distribution><global_distribution> Sonora.</global_distribution></treatment>
