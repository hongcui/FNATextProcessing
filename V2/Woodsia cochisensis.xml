  <discussion>Woodsia cochisensis traditionally has been identified as W . plummerae or (rarely) W . mexicana FÃ©e. It is readily separated from W . plummerae by the characteristics given in the key, and from North American members of the mexicana group ( W . phillipsii and W . neomexicana ) by having indusial segments that are broad and nonfilamentous at the base. Woodsia cochisensis is less glandular than typical W . mexicana from northeastern Mexico and is further distinguished from that species by the thickened, lustrous pinnule margins and well-developed hydathodes. Isozyme and chromosome studies suggest that W . cochisensis is an allotetraploid that may have originated through hybridization between W . phillipsii and an undescribed Mexican diploid (M. D. Windham 1993). It crosses with the former species to produce sterile triploids of intermediate morphology.</discussion>
