Roots  emerging from point of origin on underside of main stems.  Horizontal stems  on substrate surface or subterranean, long-creeping.  Upright shoots  scattered along horizontal stem, 5--16 mm diam., round or flat in cross section, unbranched or with 1--4 lateral branchlets.  Leaves  not imbricate, linear to linear-lanceolate; leaves on horizontal stems scattered, appressed, membranous; leaves on lateral branchlets mostly 6-ranked or more, monomorphic with few exceptions, appressed, ascending to spreading, margins entire to dentate.  Gemmiferous branchlets and gemmae  absent.  Strobili  single and sessile or multiple and pedunculate, apex blunt to acute; peduncle, when present, conspicuously leafy; sporophylls extremely reduced, much shorter than peduncle or stem leaves.  Sporangia  reniform.  Spores  reticulate, sides at equator convex, angles acute.  Gametophytes  nonphotosynthetic, mycorrhizal, subterranean, flat and irregularly button-shaped, with ring meristem around circumference.  x  = 34.</description><discussion>In striking contrast to Diphasiastrum , Huperzia , and Lycopodiella , interspecific hybridization is practically unknown in Lycopodium . Many of the species now recognized in Lycopodium have been segregated from Lycopodium clavatum , L . annotinum , and L . jussiaei Desvaux ex Poiret. The three groups given in the key below should probably be treated as subgenera.</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Species 15--25 (6 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> mainly temperate and subarctic.</global_distribution><references heading="SELECTED REFERENCES"><reference>Hickey, R.
