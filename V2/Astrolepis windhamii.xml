Leaves  10--50 cm.  Blade  pinnate-pinnatifid, pinna pairs 20--45.  Pinnae  ovate to deltate, largest 7--15 mm, usually symmetrically lobed, lobes 6--11, broadly rounded, separated by shallow sinuses; abaxial scales concealing surface, lanceolate, usually 1--1.5 mm, ciliate with coarse marginal projections; adaxial scales sparse, mostly persistent, elongate, usually stellate, attached at base, body 2--4 cells wide.  Sporangia  containing 32 spores.  n  = 2 n  = 87, apogamous.</description><discussion>Recent isozyme analyses (D. M. Benham 1989) indicate that Astrolepis windhamii is an apogamous allotriploid that contains three different genomes, one each from A . sinuata , A . cochisensis , and an unnamed Mexican taxon related to A . crassifolia . Because of this genomic constitution, Astrolepis windhamii tends to bridge the morphologic gap between A . sinuata and A . integerrima , which is itself a hybrid between A . cochisensis and the unnamed Mexican species. Although the features that separate these taxa are subtle, the pinna lobing and scale characteristics of A . windhamii mentioned in the key adequately distinguish them in most cases.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--fall</phenology><habitat> Rocky hillsides and cliffs</habitat><habitat> occurring on calcareous and noncalcareous substrates</habitat><elevation> 1200--2100 m</elevation><us_distribution> Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.Mex.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Tex.</us_distribution><global_distribution> n Mexico.</global_distribution></treatment>
