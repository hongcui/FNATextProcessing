Bark  pale gray, from distance appearing whitish to light gray and smooth, in age separating into thin plates.  Branches  spreading to ascending, often persistent to trunk base; twigs stout, pale red-brown, with light brown, often glandular puberulence, somewhat roughened by elevated scars, aging gray to pale gray-brown.  Buds  ovoid, light red-brown, 0.8--1cm; scale margins entire.  Leaves  5 per fascicle, mostly ascending and upcurved, persisting 5--8 years, 3--7cm × 1--1.5(--2)mm, mostly connivent, deep yellow-green, abaxial surface less so, adaxial surface conspicuously whitened by stomates, margins rounded, minutely serrulate distally, apex conic-acute; sheath 0.8--1.2cm, shed early.  Pollen cones  cylindro-ovoid, ca. 10--15mm, scarlet.  Seed cones  remaining on tree (unless dislodged by animals), not opening naturally but through animal agency, spreading, symmetric, broadly ovoid to depressed-ovoid or nearly globose, 4--8cm, dull gray- to black-purple, sessile to short-stalked; scales thin-based and easily broken off; apophyses much thickened, strongly cross-keeled, tip upcurved, brown; umbo terminal, short, incurved, broadly triangular, tip acute.  Seeds  obovoid; body 7--11mm, chestnut brown, wingless. 2 n =24.</description><discussion>Although two reliable dendrologists, G. B. Sudworth (1917) and N. T.
