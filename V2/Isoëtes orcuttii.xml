Rootstock nearly globose 2(--3)-lobed. Leaves deciduous, bright green, pale toward base, less than 8 cm, gradually tapering to tip, often surrounded at base by several black scales to ca. 5 mm, spirally arranged, pliant, gradually tapering to tip. Velum covering entire sporangium. Sporangium wall unpigmented. Megaspores white to gray, lustrous, 200--380 μm diam., ± smooth to obscurely tuberculate; girdle obscure. Microspores brown in mass, 20--30 μm, smooth to papillose. 2n = 22.</description><discussion>Isoëtes orcuttii, a vernal pool endemic, may be difficult to distinguish from I. nuttallii, which occurs in a wider range of habitats. Plants of I. orcuttii are generally smaller than those of I. nuttallii, which has longer, thicker, less flexible leaves and larger megaspores.</discussion><phenology>Spores mature in spring</phenology><habitat> Vernal pools</habitat><elevation> mostly 0--1500 m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico in Baja California.</global_distribution></treatment>
