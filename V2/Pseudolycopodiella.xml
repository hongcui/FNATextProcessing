Roots  emerging immediately on underside of stems.  Horizontal stems  on substrate surface, short-creeping.  Upright shoots  not branched, forming sparsely leafy peduncles scattered along horizontal stem, nearly naked, 9--11 mm diam.  Leaves  of horizontal stems not in distinct ranks, not imbricate, dimorphic, margins entire; lateral leaves narrowly linear, nearly subulate, median leaves 1/2--2/3 shorter than lateral leaves, ascending.  Gemmiferous branchlets and gemmae  absent.  Strobili  solitary, not conspicuously differentiated from peduncle, tip blunt; peduncle nearly naked with scattered minute leaves, 0.9--3 mm diam.; sporophylls much shorter than peduncle leaves.  Sporangia  reniform.  Spores  rugulate, sides at equator convex, angles acute.  Gametophytes  photosynthetic, on substrate surface, tuber-shaped and lobed; ring meristem absent.  x  = 35.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 12 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> widespread.</global_distribution><references heading="SELECTED REFERENCES"><reference>Bruce, J.
