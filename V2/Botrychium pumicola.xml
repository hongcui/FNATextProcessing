  <discussion>Botrychium pumicola is a famous narrow endemic known from only a few colonies on fully exposed pumice scree on the sides of and in the general vicinity of Crater Lake, Klamath and Deschutes counties, Oregon. This plant has a very congested appearance with an extremely compact sporangial cluster and overlapping pinnae. Like most other members of subg. Botrychium , the trophophore is located high on the common stalk, but the common stalk is subterranean, giving the impression that the leaf originates near ground level. Botrychium pumicola has been found growing with B . lanceolatum and B . simplex .</discussion>
