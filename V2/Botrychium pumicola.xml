This plant has a very congested appearance with an extremely compact sporangial cluster and overlapping pinnae. Like most other members of subg. Botrychium , the trophophore is located high on the common stalk, but the common stalk is subterranean, giving the impression that the leaf originates near ground level. Botrychium pumicola has been found growing with B . lanceolatum and B . simplex .</discussion><phenology>Leaves appearing in summer</phenology><habitat> Pumice scree</habitat><conservation> of conservation concern</conservation><elevation> 1900--2500m</elevation><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution></treatment>
