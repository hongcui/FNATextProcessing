Leaves  clustered, 7--30 cm; vernation circinate.  Petiole  straw-colored, shallowly grooved distally on adaxial surface.  Blade  elongate-pentagonal, 4-pinnate at base, 3--10 cm wide; rachis grooved adaxially, lacking scales, with monomorphic pubescence.  Pinnae  not articulate, color of stalk continuing into pinna base, basal pair larger than adjacent pair, strongly inequilateral, proximal basiscopic pinnules greatly enlarged, appearing hirsute adaxially.  Costae  green or straw-colored adaxially for entire length; abaxial scales absent.  Ultimate segments  oblong to lanceolate, not especially beadlike, the largest 3--5 mm, abaxially and adaxially hirsute with long, noncapitate hairs.  False indusia  marginal, weakly differentiated, 0.05--0.25 mm wide.  Sori  usually discontinuous, concentrated on apical and lateral lobes.  Sporangia  containing 32 spores. 2 n  = 60.</description><discussion>In North America, Cheilanthes leucopoda is known only from the Edwards Plateau in west central Texas. It is unique among local Cheilanthes species in being a sexual diploid that consistently produces 32 spores per sporangium.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--fall</phenology><habitat> Rocky slopes and ledges</habitat><habitat> apparently confined to limestone</habitat><elevation> 300--500 m</elevation><us_distribution> Tex.</us_distribution><global_distribution> n Mexico.</global_distribution></treatment>
