Leaves  monomorphic, erect, 1--1.5 dm; bulblets absent.  Petiole  1/6--1/4 length of leaf; scales tan, sparse or falling off early.  Blade  linear-lanceolate, 1-pinnate, gradually tapered to base.  Pinnae  ± deltate to ovate, slightly overlapping, in 1 plane, 4--8 mm; base truncate, acroscopic auricle well developed; margins denticulate, not spiny; apex rounded, not dentate; microscales linear, lacking projections, dense on both surfaces.  Indusia  entire to minutely erose-dentate.  Spores  brown.</description><discussion>Polystichum aleuticum is known only from Atka and Adak islands, Alaska. Its nearest relatives are in southwest China. Polystichum aleuticum resembles the dwarfed plants of P . kruckebergii , but it differs, especially, in its smaller, more rounded pinna apices and more abundant scales.</discussion><habitat>Growing in crevices of rocks</habitat><conservation> of conservation concern</conservation><elevation> 0--400 m</elevation><us_distribution> Alaska.</us_distribution></treatment>
