Stems  long-creeping, branched, 0.5--1.5 mm diam., not whitish pruinose; scales bicolored, rhombic, glabrous, margins entire or toothed.  Leaves  monomorphic or dimorphic, well separated, not narrowed toward tip, to 17 cm; fertile leaves often narrower and longer than sterile leaves.  Petiole  articulate to stem, straw-colored to greenish, somewhat flattened.  Blade  simple, linear-elliptic to linear oblanceolate, glabrous, or sparsely scaly on midrib, margins entire to crenate.  Veins  obscure, forming a row of costal areoles and often additional areoles toward blade margins, areoles often with 1--several free included veinlets.  Sori  in 1 row between midrib and margin on included veinlets, discrete, round [elongate]; indument of threadlike scales or absent.  Spores  tuberculate to rugose.  x  = 37.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 20--30 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> tropical</global_distribution><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Africa.</global_distribution><author>Clifton E.
