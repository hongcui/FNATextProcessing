Leaves  monomorphic (dimorphic in 1 species), clustered or well separated.  Blades  pinnate or pinnatifid.  Rachises and costae  scaly.  Veins  anastomosing in both sterile and fertile leaves, forming a regular series of areoles along costae and costules, further anastomosing in 1 species.  Sori  discrete, in chainlike rows along costae or costules, extending only the length of individual areolar veins.  Spores  with perine irregularly folded.  x  = 34, 35.</description><discussion>Woodwardia radicans (Linnaeus) Smith has been reported as an escape from cultivation in Florida and in the Sierra Nevada in California; it has not persisted. It and the commonly cultivated Woodwardia unigemmata Makino resemble Woodwardia fimbriata Smith, but both W . radicans and W . unigemmata are distinguished by having a scaly bulblet near the apex of the leaf.</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Species 14 (3 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Mediterranean Europe</global_distribution><global_distribution> e Asia.</global_distribution><author>Raymond B.
