Leaves  scattered, 7--35 cm; vernation noncircinate.  Petiole  usually dark brown, rounded adaxially.  Blade  oblong-lanceolate, 3--4-pinnate at base, 2--5 cm wide; rachis rounded adaxially, with scattered linear-lanceolate scales and sparse monomorphic pubescence.  Pinnae  not articulate, dark color of stalk continuing into pinna base, basal pair not conspicuously larger than adjacent pair, usually equilateral, appearing glabrous adaxially.  Costae  green adaxially for most of length; abaxial scales multiseriate, lanceolate-ovate, truncate or subcordate at base, without overlapping basal lobes, conspicuous, the largest 0.4--0.8 mm wide, strongly imbricate, often concealing ultimate segments, ciliate, with coarse cilia often confined to proximal 1/2.  Ultimate segments  round to oblong, beadlike, the largest 1--3 mm, abaxially glabrous or with a few small scales near base, adaxially glabrous.  False indusia  marginal, weakly differentiated, 0.05--0.25 mm wide.  Sori  ± continuous around segment margins.  Sporangia  containing 32 spores.  n  = 2 n  = 90, apogamous.</description><discussion>Like its close relative Cheilanthes lindheimeri , C . wootonii is an apogamous triploid of unknown parentage. With the recognition of C . yavapensis as a distinct species, the name C . wootonii is restricted to populations with leaf blades that appear glabrous adaxially, costal scales that are often ciliate only in the proximal half, and stem scales that are usually brown and loosely appressed. In addition, C. wootonii is distinguished from C. yavapensis by having smaller spores, averaging less than 62 µm in diameter. These characteristics can be subtle, and some specimens will be difficult to place in either C . wootonii or C . yavapensis . T. Reeves (1979) identified several specimens from Arizona that he hypothesized were hybrids between C . wootonii and C . fendleri .</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--fall</phenology><habitat> Rocky slopes and ledges, usually on igneous substrates</habitat><elevation> 800--2900 m</elevation><us_distribution> Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Colo.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Nev.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.Mex.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Okla.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Tex.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Utah</us_distribution><global_distribution> n Mexico.</global_distribution></treatment>
