Leaves  clustered, 6--30 cm; vernation circinate.  Petiole  dark brown, flattened or slightly grooved distally on adaxial surface.  Blade  narrowly oblong to linear, 3-pinnate-pinnatifid at base, 1--4 cm wide; rachis flattened or slightly grooved adaxially, lacking scales, with monomorphic pubescence.  Pinnae  not articulate, dark color of stalk continuing into pinna base, basal pair slightly smaller than adjacent pair, Â± equilateral, appearing glandular pubescent adaxially.  Costae  green adaxially for most of length; abaxial scales absent.  Ultimate segments  oblong to lanceolate, not beadlike, the largest 3--4 mm, abaxially and adaxially glandular-pubescent with short, sticky, capitate glands.  False indusia  marginal, weakly differentiated, 0.05--0.25 mm wide.  Sori  usually discontinuous, concentrated on apical and lateral lobes.  Sporangia  containing 64 spores.</description><discussion>Cheilanthes viscida is confined to a relatively small region in the deserts of California. Variations in spore size among populations suggest that the species may include more than one cytotype.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating late spring--fall</phenology><habitat> Cliffs and rocky slopes, usually on igneous substrates</habitat><elevation> 200--1300 m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico in Baja California.</global_distribution></treatment>
