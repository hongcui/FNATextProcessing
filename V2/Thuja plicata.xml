Its soft but extremely durable wood is valued for home construction, production of shakes and shingles, and many other uses. Native Americans of the Northwest Coast used it to build lodges, totem poles, and seagoing canoes. Many cultivars are grown for ornament, and the species is managed for timber in Europe and New Zealand.</discussion><discussion>Western redcedar ( Thuja plicata ) is the provincial tree of British Columbia.</discussion><habitat>On various substrates, commonly in moist sites, mixed coniferous forests, usually not in pure stands</habitat><habitat> 0--1500(--2000) m</habitat><ca_distribution> Alta.</ca_distribution><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Alaska</us_distribution><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Idaho</us_distribution><us_distribution> Mont.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wash.</us_distribution></treatment>
