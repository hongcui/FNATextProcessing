Bark  gray to red-brown, shallowly fissured, with long, flat, irregular ridges.  Branches  contorted; twigs pale red-brown, aging gray, puberulent, young branches resembling long bottlebrushes because of persistent leaves.  Buds  ovoid-acuminate, pale red-brown, ca. 1cm, resinous.  Leaves  5 per fascicle, upcurved, persisting 10--17 years, (2--)3--4cm Ã— 0.8--1mm, mostly connivent, deep blue-green, with drops and scales of resin, abaxial surface with strong, narrow median groove, adaxial surfaces conspicuously whitened by stomates, margins entire or distantly serrulate, apex conic-acute to conic-subulate; sheath 0.5--1.5cm, scales soon recurving, shed early.  Pollen cones  ellipsoid, ca. 10mm, bluish to red.  Seed cones  maturing in 2 years, shedding seeds and falling soon thereafter, spreading, symmetric, lance-cylindric before opening, lance-ovoid to ovoid or cylindric when open, 6--11cm, purple to brown, nearly sessile; apophyses much thickened; umbo central, with triangular base, extended into slender, brittle prickle 4--10mm.  Seeds  obliquely obovoid; body 5--6mm, gray-brown to near black; wing ca. 10--13mm. 2 n =24.</description><discussion>Pinus aristata has leaves usually narrower and sharper than in P . longaeva and P . balfouriana , and the leaves almost always have a narrow, median groove on the abaxial surface.</discussion><habitat>Subalpine and alpine</habitat><elevation> 2500--3400m</elevation><us_distribution> Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Colo.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.Mex.</us_distribution></treatment>
