Bark  reddish brown, scaly, with deep furrows between flat, flaky, cinnamon-colored plates.  Branches  horizontal, occasionally drooping in lower crown of open-grown trees; twigs orange-brown, initially pubescent, becoming glabrous or very sparsely pubescent during first year.  Buds  dark brown, generally puberulent, scale margins erose.  Leaves  of short shoots 2--5cm × 0.65--0.80mm, 0.4--0.6mm thick, keeled abaxially, with shallow convex midrib adaxially, pale green; resin canals 20--50 µm from margins, each surrounded by 5--7 epithelial cells.  Seed cones  2--3 × 1.3--1.6cm, on curved stalks 2.5--4.5 × 3.5--5mm; scales 45--55, margins entire, adaxial surface pubescent; bracts tipped by awn to 3mm, exceeding scales by ca. 4mm.  Pollen  71--84µm diam.  Seeds  reddish brown, body 3mm, wing 6mm. 2 n =24.</description><discussion>Western larch, when forest grown, is usually branch-free over most of its height. This is one of the most valuable timber-producing species in western North America. Its wood is made into framing, railway ties, pilings, exterior and interior finishing work, and pulp. In some localities it is the preferred firewood.</discussion><habitat>Mountain valleys and lower slopes</habitat><elevation> 500--1600m</elevation><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Idaho</us_distribution><us_distribution> Mont.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wash.</us_distribution></treatment>
