Bark  gray, thin to thick, with age becoming brown, often with reddish periderm visible in furrows bounded by hard flat ridges.  Branches  spreading, drooping; twigs mostly opposite, light brown, pubescent.  Buds  exposed, purple, green, or brown, globose, small to moderately large, resinous, apex round; basal scales short, broad, equilaterally triangular, slightly pubescent or glabrous, resinous, margins entire, apex pointed or slightly rounded.  Leaves  (1--)2--6cm × l.5--2.5mm, 2-ranked, flexible, with leaves at center of branch segment longer than those near ends, or with distinct long and short leaves intermixed, proximal portion ± straight, leaves higher in tree spiraled and 1-ranked; cross section flat, grooved adaxially; odor pungent, faintly turpentinelike; abaxial surface with 5--7 stomatal rows on each side of midrib; adaxial surface light to dark lustrous green, lacking stomates or with a few stomates toward leaf apex; apex distinctly notched (rarely rounded); resin canals small, near margins and abaxial epidermal layer.  Pollen cones  at pollination bluish red, purple, orange, yellow, or ± green.  Seed cones  cylindric, (5--)6--7(--12) × 3--3.5cm, light green, dark blue, deep purple, or gray, sessile, apex rounded; scales ca. 2--2.5 × 2--2.5cm, densely pubescent; bracts included.  Seeds  6--8 × 3--4mm, body tan; wing about 1.5 times as long as body, tan with rosy tinge; cotyledons (4--)5--6(--7). 2 n =24.</description><discussion>Abies grandis is rather uniform morphologically and chemically. At its southern limit in southern Oregon and northern California, it introgresses with A . concolor (J.L. Hamrick and W.J. Libby 1972; E.Zavarin et al. 1975; D.B. Zobel 1973). In the area of introgression, specimens in lower, wetter habitats are best assigned to A . grandis ; those in higher, drier habitats, to A . concolor . Others are best considered to be A . concolor × grandis .</discussion><habitat>Moist, coastal coniferous forests and mountain slopes</habitat><elevation> 0--1500m</elevation><ca_distribution> B.C.</ca_distribution><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Idaho</us_distribution><us_distribution> Mont.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wash.</us_distribution></treatment>
