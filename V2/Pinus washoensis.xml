Bark  yellow-brown to reddish, fissured, plates scaly.  Branches  spreading-ascending; twigs stout, orangish, aging gray, rough.  Buds  ovoid, red-brown, 1.5--2cm, not resinous; scale margins fringed.  Leaves  (2--)3 per fascicle, spreading-ascending, persisting (2--)4--6(--7) years, 10--15cm × ca. 1.5mm, slightly twisted, gray-green, all surfaces with stomatal lines, margins finely serrulate, apex acuminate; sheath 1--2cm, base persistent.  Pollen cones  cylindric, 10--20mm, red-purple.  Seed cones  maturing in 2 years, shedding seeds soon thereafter, not persistent, spreading, slightly asymmetric, ovoid-conic before opening, broadly ovoid when open, 7--10cm, tan or pale red-brown, sessile, abaxial surface of scales darker and sharply contrasting in color with adaxial surface; apophyses slightly raised, low pyramidal; umbo central, narrowly pyramidal, tapering into short, reflexed, fine prickle.  Seeds  ellipsoid; body ca. 0.8cm, gray-brown; wing to 16mm. 2 n =24.</description><discussion>Pinus washoensis often occurs in large stands and resembles P . jeffreyi . The number and posture of seed-cone scales fall within the ranges given for P . jeffreyi . The abaxial surface of these scales has a significantly darker pigmentation, however; such a color contrast is not apparent in P . jeffreyi . Forest geneticists have developed hybrids between P . washoensis and related yellow pines, but no natural hybrids have been observed. Some workers regard P . washoensis as closely related to---or even conspecific with--- P . ponderosa .</discussion><habitat>Dry montane forests</habitat><conservation> of conservation concern</conservation><elevation> 2100--2500m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Nev.</us_distribution></treatment>
