Leaves  bright green or glaucous, arching to pendent, scattered, 3--13 dm.  Petiole  1.5--5 dm, smooth, with a few scales near base.  Blade  pinnately and deeply lobed, 3--8 × 1--5 dm, glabrous, terminal segment conform.  Segments  lanceolate to elliptic, or linear-lanceolate to linear, 6--20 × 1--4 cm, margins entire or sometimes undulate.  Sori  in 1 line on each side of costae, occasionally 2d row present, sori terminal or at junction of free included veinlets. 2 n  = 148.</description><discussion>Phlebodium aureum occurs north to Dixie and Nassau counties in Florida, and it is disjunct in Franklin County. It is also found in Georgia (W. H. Duncan 1954; L. H. Snyder Jr. and J. G. Bruce 1986). Two varieties (or subspecies) have been recognized, Phlebodium aureum var. aureum and P . aureum var. areolatum (Humboldt &amp; Bonpland ex Willdenow) Farwell. The latter is now often elevated to species rank and given the name P . pseudoaureum (Cavanilles) Lellinger. Phlebodium pseudoaureum is widespread in Central America and South America (D. B. Lellinger 1987) and has been reported as rare in Florida by G. R. Proctor (1985). I have not seen specimens that could be convincingly referred to P . pseudoaureum .</discussion><discussion>Phlebodium aureum , a tetraploid species, is believed to have arisen through allopolyploidy following hybridization between P . pseudoaureum and P . decumanum (Willdenow) J. Smith, a widespread species in tropical America.</discussion><habitat>Epiphytic on a variety of trees or on logs, dense piles of humus, but most commonly among old leaf bases of  Sabal palmetto  Loddiges, in various habitats from hammocks to swamps</habitat><elevation> 0 m</elevation><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Ga.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America.</global_distribution></treatment>
