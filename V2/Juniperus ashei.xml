Bark  brown, exfoliating in thin strips, that of small branchlets (5--10 mm diam.) smooth, that of larger branchlets exfoliating in strips.  Branches  spreading to ascending; branchlets erect, 3--4-sided in cross section, ca. 2/3 or less as wide as length of scalelike leaves.  Leaves  dark green, abaxial glands hemispheric, raised (particularly obvious on whip leaves), exudate absent, margins denticulate (at 20Ã—); whip leaves 3--6 mm, not glaucous adaxially; scalelike leaves 1--2 mm, not overlapping or overlapping to 1/4 their length, keeled, apex acute to obtuse, spreading.  Seed cones  maturing in 1 year, of 1 size, with straight peduncles, ovoid to nearly globose, 6--9 mm, dark blue, glaucous, fleshy and resinous, with 1(--3) seeds.  Seeds  4--6 mm. 2 n  = 22.</description><discussion>The name Juniperus mexicana Sprengel has been misapplied to this species.
