Petioles  3.1--5.7 cm, sparsely pubescent.  Pinnae  6--15 × 5--14 mm, pilose.  Sporocarp stalks  erect, unbranched, attached at base of petiole, sometimes bent near apex, 5--10 mm.  Sporocarps  nodding, 5--6 × 3.6--4 mm, 1.5 mm thick, ovate in lateral view, covered with long straight hairs when young but eventually glabrate; raphe 0.8--1 mm, proximal tooth 0.2--0.6 mm, curved away from sporocarp, distal tooth up to 0.4 mm, broad, blunt or absent.  Sori  14--20.</description><discussion>Marsilea oligospora recently has been resegregated from M . vestita (D. M. Johnson 1986), from which it differs consistently in its nodding sporocarps that lack a pronounced distal tooth and its pilose leaves and stems. Where their ranges overlap, M . oligospora also has longer sporocarp stalks than does M . vestita . Plants of this species were recently grown from spores 100 years old (D. M. Johnson 1985).</discussion><phenology>Sporocarps produced summer--fall (Jun--Oct)</phenology><habitat> Around ponds and marshes, in wet depressions in sagebrush and less commonly on river margins</habitat><elevation> 700--2400 m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Idaho</us_distribution><us_distribution> Mont.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Nev.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Utah</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wash.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Wyo.</us_distribution></treatment>
