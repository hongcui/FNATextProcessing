Bark  red-brown, cracked and irregularly fissured.  Branches  alternate or whorled, becoming rigid, angle of divergence about 25°.  Twigs  bright green, becoming yellow-green with age, not viscid, ridges between longitudinal grooves papillate, slightly scabrous; internodes 2--5 cm.  Terminal buds  conic, 1--3 mm.  Leaves  opposite, 2--5 mm, connate to 1/2--3/4 their length; bases thickened, brown, persistent, becoming hard, enlarged, and black; apex acute.  Pollen cones  2--several at node, obovoid, 4--6 mm, on very short, scaly peduncles (rarely sessile); bracts opposite, 5--9 pairs, light yellow, ovate, 2--4 × 2--3 mm, membranous, slightly connate at base; bracteoles slightly exceeding bracts; sporangiophores 2--4 mm, 1/4 exserted, with 5--7 sessile to short-stalked (less than 1 mm) microsporangia.  Seed cones  2--several at node, obovoid to nearly globose, 7--15 mm, on smooth peduncles, 5--25 mm, with 1 pair of basal and 1 pair of nearly terminal bracts, at least in early cones; bracts opposite, 3--4 pairs, ovate to circular, 5--8 × 5--12 mm, inner pairs becoming fleshy (at least centrally) and orange at maturity.  Seeds  2, ellipsoid, 5--8 × 2--4 mm, brown to chestnut, smooth.</description><discussion>In New Mexico Ephedra coryi occurs only in an isolated population in the San Andreas Mountains and represents the shorter extreme (5--10 mm) in the range of peduncle length.</discussion><phenology>Coning March--April</phenology><habitat> Sandy, semiarid areas</habitat><elevation> 500--2300 m</elevation><us_distribution> N.Mex.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Tex.</us_distribution></treatment>
