Horizontal stems  branching, stolonlike, rooting where they touch ground.  Upright shoots  usually 1 to each arch of horizontal stems, to 3.5 mm diam., unequally, dichotomously branched with well-differentiated lateral branchlets much branched.  Leaves  not in distinct ranks, not imbricate, monomorphic, generally ascending, linear-needlelike, margin entire.  Gemmiferous branchlets and gemmae  absent.  Strobili  solitary, sessile, nodding to pendent, tip blunt; sporophylls smaller than vegetative leaves.  Sporangia  nearly globose.  Spore  surface rugulate; sides convex at equator.  Gametophytes  photosynthetic, on substrate surface, pincushion-shaped; ring meristem absent.</description><discussion>Palhinhaea is a very common genus in Lycopodiaceae worldwide.</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Species 10--15 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> mainly pantropical and subtropical.</global_distribution></treatment>
