Roots  numerous.  Stems  mainly erect, covered with many stiff hairs 1--3 cells long, with simple siphonostele (hollow vascular cylinder).  Leaves  tufted, monomorphic or dimorphic.  Petioles  much longer than blades, blades reduced to tiny apical fistlike or radiating groups of rudimentary fertile pinnae ("digits").  Petioles  sometimes repeatedly dichotomous, in some species webbed between branches to form fan-shaped false blades.  Sporangia  arranged in 1--4 ranks on abaxial surface of digits with revolute margins.  Annulus  subapical, composed of 1--(2--3) layer(s) of thickened cells.  Gametophytes  subterranean and not green or borne aboveground and green, tuberlike or flattened, cordate or filamentous.  Spores  bilateral, monolete.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Genera 2--3, species 30 (2 genera, 2 species in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> nearly worldwide</global_distribution><global_distribution> mainly in tropical areas.</global_distribution><author>Warren H.
