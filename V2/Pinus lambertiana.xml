Bark  cinnamon- to gray-brown, deeply furrowed, plates long, scaly.  Branches  spreading, distal branches ascending; twigs gray-green to red-tan, aging gray, mostly puberulent.  Buds  cylindro-ovoid, red-brown, to 0.8cm, resinous.  Leaves  5 per fascicle, spreading to ascending, persisting 2--4 years, 5--10cm Ã— (0.9--)1--1.5(--2)mm, straight, slightly twisted, pliant, blue-green, abaxial surface with only a few lines evident, adaxial surfaces with evident white stomatal lines, margins finely serrulate, apex acuminate; sheath (1--)1.5--2cm, shed early.  Pollen cones  ellipsoid-cylindric, to 15mm, yellow.  Seed cones  maturing in 2 years, shedding seeds and falling soon thereafter, often clustered, pendent, symmetric, cylindric before opening, lance-cylindric to ellipsoid-cylindric when open, 25--50cm, yellow-brown, stalks 6--15cm; apophyses somewhat thickened; umbo terminal, depressed, resinous, slightly excurved.  Seeds  obovoid, oblique apically; body 1--2cm, deep brown; wing broad, 2--3cm. 2 n =24.</description><discussion>The largest species of the genus, Pinus lambertiana also has the longest seed cone in the genus. It is an important timber tree with harvest far exceeding regrowth. It is easily distinguished from P . monticola and P . strobus by its larger cones and thicker cone scales with larger seeds; it is somewhat less reliably distinguished by its leaves, which are slightly wider and more tapering-tipped and have some stomatal lines evident on the abaxial surfaces (the lines not evident in P . monticola and P . strobus ). A "sugary" resin high in cyclitols exudes from the sweet-scented fresh-cut wood.</discussion><habitat>Montane dry to moist forests</habitat><elevation> 330--3200m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Nev.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Oreg.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico in n Baja California.</global_distribution></treatment>
