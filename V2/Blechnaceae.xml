Presl</family_authority></TaxonIdentification><common_name>Chain Fern Family</common_name><description>Plants  perennial, mostly terrestrial, occasionally on rock or epiphytic.  Stems  creeping to suberect or ascending, sometimes climbing [rarely arborescent], slender to stout, dictyostelic, scaly.  Leaves  monomorphic or dimorphic, large and coarse, generally greater than 30 cm, often exceeding 1 m.  Petiole  not articulate, generally more than 2 vascular bundles arranged in arc, generally scaly at least at base.  Blade  often anthocyanic (reddish) when young, pinnatifid [rarely simple] to pinnate-pinnatifid or 2-pinnate [rarely decompound], glabrous or occasionally bearing scales or capitate glands.  Rachis  frequently grooved adaxially.  Veins  of sterile leaves generally free, rarely anastomosing, veins of fertile leaves united to form sorus-bearing secondary vein parallel to costa or costule (vascular commisure), sometimes anastomosing further.  Sori  elongate along secondary vein; indusia present [rarely absent], opening along costal side of fertile vein, frequently hidden by dehisced sporangia; sporangial stalk of 3 rows of cells.  Spores  monolete, reniform; perine present, variously ornamented.  Gametophytes  green, cordate, sometimes bearing capitate hairs, antheridia and archegonia borne on lower surface.</description><discussion>Circumscription of genera is controversial, especially as to placement of those species now included in Blechnum . Characteristics holding the family together include the anastomoses of veins along the axes of the blade to form a series of areoles or a single continuous vein along which the sorus is borne, elongate sori with indusia opening toward midvein, bilateral spores, and chromosome base numbers of generally x = 28--36. Relationships of the family with both dryopteroid and athyrioid ferns have been suggested.</discussion><discussion>Stenochlaena tenuifolia (Desvaux) T. Moore, native to the Old World, was reported as escaped from cultivation in the 1930s in southern Florida; it has not been collected there recently. It is distinguished by having climbing stems and by having contracted, 2-pinnate fertile leaves with sporangia covering the abaxial surface.</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Genera ca. 10, species ca. 250 (2 genera, 6 species in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> mostly tropical and south temperate (except  Woodwardia , which is north temperate).</global_distribution><author>Raymond B.
