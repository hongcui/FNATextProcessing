Bark  yellow- to red-brown, deeply irregularly furrowed, cross-checked into broadly rectangular, scaly plates.  Branches  descending to spreading-ascending; twigs stout (to 2cm thick), orange-brown, aging darker orange-brown, rough.  Buds  ovoid, to 2cm, fully 1cm broad, red-brown, very resinous; scale margins white-fringed.  Leaves  2--5 per fascicle, spreading to erect, persisting (2--)4--6(--7) years, 7--25(--30)cm × (1--)1.2--2mm, slightly twisted, tufted at twig tips, pliant, deep yellow-green, all surfaces with evident stomatal lines, margins serrulate, apex abruptly to narrowly acute or acuminate; sheath 1.5--3cm, base persistent.  Pollen cones  ellipsoid-cylindric, 1.5--3.5cm, yellow or red.  Seed cones  maturing in 2 years, shedding seeds soon thereafter, leaving rosettes of scales on branchlets, solitary or rarely in pairs, spreading to reflexed, symmetric to slightly asymmetric, conic-ovoid before opening, broadly ovoid when open, 5--15cm, mostly reddish brown, sessile to nearly sessile, scales in steep spirals (as compared to  Pinus jeffreyi ) of 5--7 per row as viewed from side, those of cones just prior to and after cone fall spreading and reflexed, thus well separate from adjacent scales; apophyses dull to lustrous, thickened and variously raised and transversely keeled; umbo central, usually pyramidal to truncated, rarely depressed, merely acute, or with a very short apiculus, or with a stout-based spur or prickle.  Seeds  ellipsoid-obovoid; body (3--)4--9mm, brown to yellow-brown, often mottled darker; wing 15--25mm.</description><discussion>Pinus ponderosa is the most economically important western yellow pine.
