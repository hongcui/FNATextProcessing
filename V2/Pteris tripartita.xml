Petiole  straw-colored to brownish red, to more than 1 m, scaly proximally, otherwise glabrous at maturity.  Blade  deltate to pentagonal, pedate, ultimate divisions pinnately divided, 1--2 × 1--2 m; rachis not winged.  Pinnae  few, closely spaced, remaining green through winter, not decurrent on rachis, not articulate to rachis, oblong-lanceolate, 1--3-forked, to 7 × 6 dm; base asymmetrical, acute; apex acute; rachis and costae glabrate or with minute hairs, especially near axils of proximal pinnae; penultimate pinnules linear to linear-lanceolate, pinnatifid, separated, not remaining green through winter, not articulate to rachis.  Ultimate segments  of blade numerous, linear-oblong to linear-lanceolate, to 19 × 6 mm, margins entire or serrulate, apex obtuse and rounded to acute; terminal segments 3--4 cm longer and more tapering than lateral segments.  Veins  anastomosing near costae and costules, becoming forked and free near margins of ultimate segments.  Sori  narrow, blade tissue exposed abaxially.</description><habitat>Terrestrial in cypress, pond-apple, and other swamps or forested wet habitats, on constantly moist, circumneutral soils</habitat><elevation> 0--50 m</elevation><introduced> introduced, naturalized in scattered locations</introduced><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America</global_distribution><global_distribution> native to tropical Asia.</global_distribution></treatment>
