Rootstock nearly globose, 2-lobed.  Leaves deciduous, olive green, pale toward base, spirally arranged, to 40 cm., pliant, gradually tapering toward tip. Velum covering less that 3/4 of sporangium. Sporangium wall ±  brown-streaked. Megaspores white, 450--650 μm diam., cristate to reticulate with broad, jagged ridges; girdle obscure. Microspores light brown in mass, 23--33 μm, papillose. 2n = 66.</description><discussion>Isoëtes georgiana is known only from Worth County, Georgia. An early collection from this locality was reported by B. M. Boom (1982) to be I. engelmannii x piedmontana, but the broad velum and bold texture of the megaspores suggest a possible involvement of I. flaccida.</discussion><phenology>Spores mature late summer</phenology><habitat> Creeks</habitat><conservation> of conservation concern</conservation><us_distribution> Ga.</us_distribution></treatment>
