Plants  over 12 cm.  Common stalk  lacking idioblasts (elongate, spindle-shaped cells in vascular strand).  Trophophore  sessile and erect, arising from middle to distal portion of common stalk well above ground level; blade usually 1 per plant, seasonal, absent during winter, deltate, 3--4-pinnate, 5--25 cm wide when mature, thin, herbaceous.  Leaf primordia  densely hairy, hairs 1.5--2mm.  Leaf sheath  open.  Pinna  divisions reduced in size to tip.  First pinnule  on basal pinnae usually borne acroscopically.  Sporophores  long-stalked, arising from middle to distal portion of common stalk well above ground level, commonly absent due to abortion in early development or seasonal, stalks only slightly flattened, not fleshy, 0.5--0.8mm wide.  x =92.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 2--3 (1 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> worldwide.</global_distribution></treatment>
