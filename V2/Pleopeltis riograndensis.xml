Leaves  to 20 cm, strongly hygroscopic.  Petiole  grooved, otherwise round in cross section, sparsely scaly; scales rarely overlapping, margins denticulate to ciliate.  Blade  triangular-oblong to ovate, deeply pinnatifid, to 5 cm wide, moderately scaly abaxially, glabrous adaxially; scales concolored to obscurely bicolored, usually dark reddish brown throughout, broadly ovate-lanceolate, clathrate, more than 0.5 mm wide, margins fringed-ciliate.  Venation  mostly free with occasional areoles, never more than 1 included veinlet in fertile areoles.  Sori  round, discrete, surficial to shallowly embossed, soral scales attached at periphery of receptacle.  Spores  smooth with scattered spheric deposits on surface, 60--74 Âµm. 2 n  = 148.</description><discussion>In the past Pleopeltis riograndensis has been treated as a variety of P . thyssanolepis , but it differs from the latter species in that the petiole and leaf are only sparsely scaly rather than densely so, the blade scales are mostly ovate or ovate-lanceolate rather than nearly spheric, the venation is mostly free rather than mostly areolate, and the basal segments of the blade are alternate rather than opposite to nearly opposite.</discussion><phenology>Sporulating summer--fall</phenology><habitat> Growing on rocky slopes and ledges, and in crevices, usually in moist, shaded canyons</habitat><elevation> 1500--2500 m</elevation><us_distribution> Ariz.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Texas</us_distribution><global_distribution> n Mexico.</global_distribution></treatment>
