Roots  from under surface. Petiole 30--60 cm, essentially glabrous, grooved adaxially.  Blade  broadly ovate, 3--4-pinnate, base slightly reduced, somewhat leathery, glabrous.  Pinnae  stalked, closely spaced to overlapping, lanceolate.  Pinnules  anadromous throughout.  Tertiary segments  obliquely ascending.</description><discussion>Maxonia apiifolia , known in the flora from one collection made in 1921 in southern Florida, has not been relocated and may be extirpated. J. T. Mickel (1979) suggested that it may represent a horticultural escape, but the species is not known in cultivation. Its occurrence in Florida may indicate long-distance dispersal from the West Indies. Maxonia apiifolia var. dualis (J. D. Smith) C. Christensen occurs in Central America in Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama, and in South America in Ecuador. It differs from var. apiifolia only by its entire, rather than denticulate, scales.</discussion><habitat>Climbing on trees in wooded limestone hills</habitat><elevation> 0 m</elevation><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies in Cuba</global_distribution><global_distribution> Jamaica.</global_distribution></treatment>
