Stems  decumbent to erect, or creeping, few to many branched; scales colorless or brownish, concolored or bicolored, ovate, lanceolate or linear, margins entire.  Leaves  dimorphic, scattered or densely tufted; fertile leaves 5--25 cm; sterile leaves 3--20 cm, shorter than fertile leaves.  Petiole  dark brown proximally, light brown to green distally, with single longitudinal groove adaxially, scaly, with single vascular bundle.  Blade  deltate, lanceolate to elliptic, 2--4-pinnate, somewhat leathery or herbaceous to membranaceous, abaxially glabrous, adaxially glabrous or sparsely pubescent, dull to somewhat lustrous, not striate; rachis straight.  Ultimate segments  of blade short-stalked or sessile, free or adnate to midrib; stalks dull, green; segments of sterile leaves ovate, elliptic, obovate, or fan-shaped, usually less than 4 mm wide, margins plane, dentate or shallowly to deeply cut; fertile segments strongly differentiated from sterile segments, lanceolate to linear, usually less than 2 mm wide, margins reflexed to form false indusia extending over entire length of segments, at first covering young sporangia, often becoming plane at maturity.  Veins  of ultimate segments usually obscure, free, pinnately branched and divergent distally.  False indusia  greenish to brown, broad, clearly marginal, usually concealing sporangia.  Sporangia  scattered along veins on abaxial leaf surface, often intermixed with farina-producing glands, containing 64 spores.  Spores  yellow, tetrahedral, trilete, verrucose, equatorial flange absent.  Gametophytes  glabrous.  x  = 30.</description><number_of_infrataxa>Species 8--11 (4 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> temperate regions</global_distribution><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Eurasia.</global_distribution><author>Edward R.
