Stems  prostrate, 1--1.5 cm.  Largest hairs  on upper leaf lobe near stem 2(--3)-celled; broad pedicel cell often 1/2 or more height of hair, apical cell curved, with tip nearly parallel to leaf surface.  Megaspores  not covered with raised angular bumps, pitted and sparsely covered with a few long filaments extending over surface.</description><discussion>Azolla mexicana is generally less cold tolerant and has a narrower environmental range than A . caroliniana . Both species are closely related and are similar vegetatively in culture. In the western United States, A . mexicana is often fertile. Distribution in the Great Plains area is tentative and needs further study. In the eastern United States, A . mexicana may have been occasionally introduced.</discussion></treatment>
