Bark  red-brown, irregularly furrowed and cross-checked into rectangular, flat, scaly plates.  Branches  spreading to ascending; twigs stout, orange- to yellow-orange, frequently glaucous, aging darker.  Buds  ovoid to narrowly ovoid, red-brown, 1--1.5(--2)cm, resinous.  Leaves  3 per fascicle (to 5 in adventitious or disturbed growth), spreading to ascending, persisting 2--3 years, (12--)15--20(--21)cm Ã— 1.3--1.5(--2)mm, slightly twisted, tufted at twig tips, straight, yellow-green, all surfaces with fine stomatal lines, margins serrulate, apex acuminate; sheath 1--2cm, base persistent.  Pollen cones  cylindric, to 30mm, yellow-brown.  Seed cones  maturing in 2 years, in some populations beginning to shed seeds then but more often variably serotinous, long-persistent, often whorled, symmetric, ovoid to lanceoloid before opening, broadly ovoid to nearly globose when open, 5--8cm, pale red-brown to creamy brown, sessile or on stalks to 1cm, scales with dark red-brown border on adaxial surface distally; apophyses slightly thickened, low, rhombic, low cross-keeled; umbo central, low-conic, with short, weak prickle, sometimes unarmed.  Seeds  ellipsoid, oblique at tip, somewhat compressed; body 5--6mm, pale brown, mottled darker or nearly black; wing to 20mm. 2 n =24.</description><discussion>Pinus serotina is fire successional and sprouts adventitiously after crown fires. It is part of a distinct forest type including Taxodium distichum (Linnaeus) Richard, Nyssa biflora Walter, Magnolia virginiana Linnaeus, Persea sp., and Ilex sp. Of good form when protected from fire, P . serotina then much resembles P . taeda , with which it hybridizes naturally. It is of increasing importance as pulpwood.</discussion><habitat>Flatwoods, flatwoods bogs, savannas, and barrens</habitat><elevation> 0--200m</elevation><us_distribution> Ala.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Del.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Ga.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Md.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.J.</us_distribution><us_distribution> N.C.</us_distribution><us_distribution> S.C.</us_distribution><us_distribution> Va.</us_distribution></treatment>
