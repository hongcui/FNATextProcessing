Stems  often long-creeping, usually branched, 1--2.5 mm diam., not whitish pruinose; scales bicolored with dark central region, round to ovate-lanceolate or subulate, clathrate toward center, glabrous or pubescent with reddish brown hairs, margins transparent, erose-denticulate to fringed-ciliate.  Leaves  monomorphic, widely spaced, not conspicuously narrowed at tip, to 25 cm.  Petiole  green to dark brown or black, flattened to terete, often grooved proximally and winged distally.  Blade  oblong-linear to deltate, simple and entire or deeply pinnatifid, not pectinate, with fewer than 25 pairs of segments, not glaucous, with conspicuous peltate scales on abaxial surface; rachis sparsely to densely scaly abaxially, glabrous to sparsely scaly adaxially; scales ovate-lanceolate to spheric, peltate, clathrate toward center.  Segments  (when present) linear to oblong; margins entire to crenulate; apex rounded.  Venation  mostly free or complexly anastomosing, with 1--several included veinlets in fertile areoles.  Sori  often confined to distal 1/2 of leaf, discrete or confluent, circular to oval when immature, borne at ends of single veins or at junction of several veinlets, in 1 row on either side of midrib; indument of ephemeral, peltate scales covering immature sori.  Spores  smooth with scattered spheric deposits or slightly papillate or verrucose.  x  = 34, 35, 37.</description><discussion>Pleopeltis is a neotropical genus of mostly epiphytic ferns. Its center of diversity is in southern Mexico and Central America. The genus is currently under revision, and preliminary data indicate that certain scaly-leaved species traditionally placed in the genus Polypodium are actually more closely related to Pleopeltis than they are to Polypodium . The two North American species of this scaly Polypodium group recently have been transferred to Pleopeltis (M. D. Windham 1993) and are similarly treated here.</discussion><number_of_infrataxa>Species ca. 50 (4 in the flora):</number_of_infrataxa><global_distribution> tropical regions</global_distribution><global_distribution> North America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America</global_distribution><global_distribution> Africa</global_distribution><global_distribution> Asia in India.</global_distribution><author>Elisabeth G.
