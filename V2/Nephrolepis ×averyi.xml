Tubers absent.  Leaves  8--30 × 0.5--1.3 dm.  Petiole  1.2--5 dm, moderately to densely scaly; scales spreading, reddish to light brown throughout.  Blade  moderately scaly, glabrous to occasionally pubescent abaxially, glabrous adaxially, hairs pale to light brown, 0.2--0.7 mm. Rachis 5--26 dm, points of pinna attachment 9--25 mm apart; scales scattered, brown throughout. Central pinnae narrowly deltate to oblong-deltate, 3.6--9 × 0.7--2 cm, base truncate, sometimes rounded basiscopically, barely auriculate acroscopically, acroscopic lobe obtuse to acute, margins serrulate, apex narrowly acute to attenuate, falcate to slightly so; costae adaxially sparsely pubescent, hairs pale, erect, 0.1--0.5 mm.  Indusia  horseshoe-shaped to circular, attached at narrow sinus or peltate, 0.9--1.1 mm wide. 2 n  = 164.</description><discussion>Nephrolepis × averyi is an allotetraploid derived from hybridization between N . biserrata and N . exaltata and is known to occur only in mixed populations of both parent species. It is distinguished from N . exaltata by its sparsely hairy adaxial costae, larger size, and misshapen spores, and from N . biserrata by its falcate pinnae and narrower leaves.</discussion><habitat>Terrestrial or epiphytic in forested, often moist habitats, e.g., swamps, hammocks, or relatively open, disturbed habitats</habitat><elevation> 0 m</elevation><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies.</global_distribution></treatment>
