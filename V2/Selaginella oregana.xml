  <discussion>Selaginella oregana , one of the most distinct species in the flora, is easily distinguished by its usually long, epiphytic-pendent stems, slightly loose strobili, and curled branches (in dry specimens). In the flora, S . oregana is most closely related to S . underwoodii . It is sometimes confused with S . wallacei (see discussion), and it shares some characteristics with the Mexican species, S . extensa L. Underwood. In S . oregana , very often where a branch fork occurs, one of the branches is arrested (R. M. Tryon 1955). The strobili of S . oregana are among the longest in the flora, and they often show several novel features. Very often the apex of a strobilus undergoes a period of vegetative growth, thus becoming a vegetative shoot, and after an interval the apex reverts to the fertile condition, forming a strobilus again. In other cases, the strobilus forks, giving rise to two new strobili.</discussion>
