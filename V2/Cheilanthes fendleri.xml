Fournier</species_authority></TaxonIdentification><description>Stems  long-creeping, 1--3 mm diam.; scales mostly uniformly brown, ovate-lanceolate, straight to slightly contorted, loosely appressed, often deciduous on older portions of stem.  Leaves  scattered, 7--30 cm; vernation noncircinate.  Petiole  usually dark brown, rounded adaxially.  Blade  lanceolate to ovate-deltate, 3--4-pinnate at base, 1.5--5 cm wide; rachis rounded adaxially, somewhat scaly, not pubescent.  Pinnae  not articulate, dark color of stalk continuing into pinna base, basal pair not conspicuously larger than adjacent pair, usually equilateral, appearing glabrous adaxially.  Costae  green adaxially for most of length; abaxial scales multiseriate, lanceolate-ovate, truncate or subcordate at base, without overlapping basal lobes, conspicuous, the largest 0.4--1.2 mm wide, strongly imbricate, often concealing ultimate segments, entire to denticulate, not ciliate.  Ultimate segments  round to oblong, beadlike, the largest 1.5--3 mm, abaxially glabrous or with a few small scales near base, adaxially glabrous.  False indusia  marginal, weakly differentiated, 0.05--0.25 mm wide.  Sori  Â± continuous around segment margins.  Sporangia  containing 64 spores. 2 n  = 60.</description><discussion>Young, sterile plants of Cheilanthes fendleri are occasionally misidentified as C . pringlei ; they are distinguished from that species by having rachises that are rounded (not grooved) adaxially. Cheilanthes fendleri apparently hybridizes with both C . wootonii (T. Reeves 1979) and C . covillei (M. D.
