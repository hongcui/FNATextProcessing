Bark  rough, fibrous.  Branchlets  decussate, 1.5--2 mm diam.  Leaves  without gland or sometimes with inconspicuous, shallow, pitlike, abaxial gland that does not produce drop of resin, not glaucous.  Pollen cones  4--6 × 2.5--3 mm; pollen sacs 6--10.  Seed cones  oblong, 2.5--4 cm, grayish brown, not glaucous; scales 4--6 pairs, smooth, umbo nearly flat at maturity.  Seeds  mostly 5--6 mm, dark brown, not glaucous. 2 n  = 22.</description><discussion>The geographically most restricted taxon recognized here, Cupressus macrocarpa is confined today to two picturesque groves near Monterey, but it is also known from fossils to have been in other regions. It is much planted and commonly naturalized near the coast from central California north to Washington and in warm temperate and subtropical regions worldwide.</discussion><habitat>Coastal bluffs</habitat><conservation> of conservation concern</conservation><elevation> 5--35 m</elevation><us_distribution> Calif.</us_distribution></treatment>
