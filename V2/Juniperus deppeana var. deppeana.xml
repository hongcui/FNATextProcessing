  <discussion>Although four additional varieties are found in Mexico, the relationships among the J . deppeana taxa are poorly understood and need additional study (R. P. Adams et al. 1984). The very rare J . deppeana Steudel var. deppeana forma sperryi (Correll) R. M. Adams (= J . deppeana Steudel var. sperryi Correll) is endemic to the Davis Mountains, Texas, where only two or three individuals are known to exist. This form is characterized by bark that exfoliates in thin strips and by flaccid branchlets.</discussion>
