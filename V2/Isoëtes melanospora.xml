Rootstock nearly globose, 2-lobed. Leaves deciduous, bright green, pale toward base, spirally arranged, to 7 cm, pliant, gradually tapering to tip. Velum covering entire sporangium. Sporangium wall unpigmented. Megaspores gray to black, 350--480 μm diam., tuberculate with distinct to confluent tubercles; girdle obscure. Microspores brown in mass, 26--31 μm, smooth to papillose. 2n = 22.</description><discussion>A population of plants in which the individuals have a velum incompletely covering the sporangium, a brown-pigmented sporangium wall, and dark brown megaspores occurs in Lancaster County, South Carolina.</discussion><discussion>These plants appear to be transitional between Isoëtes melanospora and I. virginica.</discussion><discussion>Plants of Isoëtes melanospora and I. tegetiformans typically grow actively after fall and winter precipitation. New leaves can appear a few days after the soil becomes saturated by rain, but normally they shrivel and disappear during summer when the soil dries.</discussion><phenology>Spores mature in late spring</phenology><habitat> Shallow depressions on granite outcrops</habitat><conservation> of conservation concern</conservation><us_distribution> Ga.</us_distribution></treatment>
