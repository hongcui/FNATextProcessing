  <discussion>Asplenium plenum occurs with its parents on limestone rocks in shaded forests and is known only from Florida, although it could occur in the Antilles, Central America, and South America (D. B. Lellinger 1981). It is noteworthy for constituting one of the first known examples of backcrossing and formation of a new taxon by unreduced spores from a sterile hybrid. According to V. M. Morzenti (1967) and G. J. Gastony (1986), hybridization between A . abscissum and A . verecundum produced A . Ã— curtissii . An unreduced spore of the hybrid gave rise to a 3 x gametophyte. This gametophyte produced a 3 x sperm that backcrossed with an x egg of A . abscissum producing the 4 x allotetraploid, A . plenum , that is not only capable of propagation by minute root proliferations like those of the parents but also to some extent by spores. This complex hypothesis was confirmed by electrophoretic comparisons of the plants involved (G. J. Gastony 1986).</discussion>
