Petiole  black, dull, glabrous or sparsely scaly proximally.  Blade  elongate-triangular to ovate-lanceolate, 2-pinnate-pinnatifid, sometimes 3-pinnate proximally, densely white-farinose abaxially.  Pinnae  narrowly triangular, pinnately lobed or divided, flat surfaces in plane of blade.  Pinnules  short-stalked or sessile, lanceolate, margins serrate to lobed near base.  Spores  with perispore reticulate and with equatorial flange.</description><discussion>Pityrogramma calomelanos var. calomelanos is commonly cultivated in greenhouses. In Florida, it is known from a small number of sites in Hillsborough and Polk counties, where it possibly escaped from cultivation. Pityrogramma calomelanos var. austroamericana (Domin) Farwell (Costa Rica to Brazil) is characterized by yellow farina; P . calomelanos var. ochracea (C. Presl) R. M. Tryon (Honduras to Bolivia) possesses scattered trichomes instead of farinose indument.</discussion><habitat>Ditches in forested areas</habitat><elevation> 0--20 m</elevation><introduced> introduced</introduced><us_distribution> Fla.</us_distribution><global_distribution> Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution> West Indies in the Antilles</global_distribution><global_distribution> Central America</global_distribution><global_distribution> South America</global_distribution><global_distribution> widely naturalized in tropical Africa.</global_distribution></treatment>
