  <discussion>Achillea nobilis was introduced in the flora area through cultivation. It has been reported in Minnesota, Massachusetts, and New York; herbarium sheets indicate that those reports were based on cultivated specimens. It was first collected in Montana in 1902; it appears to have become established in that state, where it is known from Lake and Flathead counties.</discussion>
