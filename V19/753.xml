  <description>Annuals, 1–50 cm. Stems 1, ± erect, or 2–5[–10], ascending to erect [prostrate]. Leaves cauline; mostly alternate [opposite]; blades narrowly oblanceolate to elliptic [spatulate]. Heads usually in glomerules of 2–5 in racemiform to paniculiform or distally ± dichasiform [axillary] arrays, sometimes borne singly. Involucres inconspicuous. Phyllaries 4–6, ± equal (unlike paleae, scarious, hyaline). Receptacles depressed-spheric or obovoid (heights 0.5–1.8 times diams.), glabrous. Pistillate paleae falling, erect to incurved; bodies with 5+ nerves (nerves ± parallel, obscure), obovoid, saccate most of lengths (trigonously [evenly] compressed, galeate, abaxially rounded [corniculate-crested], each enclosing a floret); wings ± erect (and lateral) or inflexed (and subapical). Staminate paleae 0 or 1–3, falling, erect in fruit (not enlarged), shorter than pistillate paleae; bodies linear-lanceolate to oblanceolate. Pistillate florets 4–12. Functionally staminate florets 2–5; corolla lobes 4–5, ± equal. Bisexual florets 0. Cypselae brown, monomorphic: ± trigonously [evenly] compressed, ± obovoid, curved, gibbous abaxially, faces glabrous, smooth, shiny, corolla scars ± lateral; pappi: pistillate 0, staminate 0 or of 1–5 bristles (hidden in heads). x = 14.</description>

  <discussion>See discussion of Filagininae following the tribal description (p. 385).</discussion>
  <discussion>Micropus species are found mostly in dry, open habitats of Mediterranean climates. In the flora, they are known only from west-draining portions of the Californian Floristic Province and the Willamette Valley in Oregon.</discussion>
  <discussion>The two North American species constitute Micropus sect. Rhyncholepis Nuttall. Recent European workers (e.g., J. Holub 1998) have included sect. Rhyncholepis in Bombycilaena, leaving M. supinus Linnaeus in a monotypic genus. Based on phylogenetic data (J. D. Morefield 1992), that approach would include in Bombycilaena species ancestral to, and derived from ancestors of, Micropus. I maintain Micropus in its traditional sense here. Micropus and Psilocarphus appear to be monophyletic sister genera derived from near or within Stylocline. A malformed specimen from Monterey County, California, appears to be a sterile hybrid between M. californicus and a species of Psilocarphus.</discussion>
