Leaves usually mostly basal, sometimes cauline as well; petiolate or sessile; blades linear to lanceolate, spatulate or oblanceolate, margins entire or pinnately lobed, abaxial faces white-woolly, adaxial usually glabrate or glabrous, sometimes arachnose. Involucres ± campanulate, turbinate, or cylindric, [5–]10–15+ mm diam. Phyllaries in 2–4 series, connate 1/2–3/4 their lengths, margins ± scarious, apices acute, abaxial faces glabrous [arachnose to tomentose]. Receptacles conic or convex, deeply alveolate (pits enclosing cypselae, their margins often ciliate). Ray florets neuter; corollas yellow, orange, or red to maroon (usually each with darker abaxial stripe and a darker adaxial spot or blotch near base), laminae 5-veined, 4-toothed. Disc florets bisexual, fertile; corollas yellow to orange. Cypselae obovoid, ribs 0, faces villous; pappi persistent, of 7–8[–12+], lanceolate to subulate-aristate scales in 2 series (± hidden by hairs on cypselae). x = 9.</description>
