  <discussion>E. McClintock (1993b) reported Matricaria occidentalis as being used as a substitute for chamomile. In California, the species is found in the Coast Ranges to the South Coast, in parts of the San Joaquin Valley, and in the High Cascade, Sierra Nevada, and Desert Ranges and surrounding areas. Although listed as secure, the species appears to have been eradicated from some counties in California and its range may be shrinking due to disappearance of its habitat.</discussion>
