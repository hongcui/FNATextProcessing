  <discussion>Shinnersoseris rostrata was included in Lygodesmia; Tomb presented evidence for placing it in a separate genus. It differs from Lygodesmia in having opposite proximal leaves, shorter, obscure ligules, shorter style branches, 8–10-ribbed cypselae, echinate pollen, and a different base chromosome number (x = 9 in Lygodesmia.)</discussion>
