  <discussion>The species is included among the invasive species of California (C. C. Bossard et
        al. 2000); it is native to the Cape region of South Africa, long cultivated in Europe, and
        now widely offered for sale on the internet. In contrast to the assessment of invasiveness
        in California, one commercial website selling the species notes this “forms tangled mounds
        of trailing grey-felted leaves. Given something to scramble up, it will climb. And although
        this description makes it sound fairly rampant, it is definitely not invasive.” It is often
        recommended for planters and hanging baskets, where the silvery leaves provide backdrop for
        bright colors.</discussion>
  <discussion>The name Helichrysum petiolatum D. Don has been misapplied to plants of H.
        petiolare.</discussion>
