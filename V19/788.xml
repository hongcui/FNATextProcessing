  <description>Annuals or perennials [subshrubs, shrubs, or trees]. Leaves basal and/or cauline
    (basal often withering before flowering); alternate [opposite]; petiolate or sessile; margins
    entire or dentate to serrate [pinnately divided]. Heads heterogamous (radiate [disciform])
    [homogamous (discoid)], usually in corymbiform, paniculiform, or racemiform arrays, sometimes
    borne singly (on ± leafy stems). Calyculi 0. Phyllaries persistent [falling], in (2–)3–7+
    series, distinct, unequal to subequal, herbaceous to chartaceous or membranous, margins and/or
    apices usually scarious. Receptacles flat to convex [concave], epaleate [paleate]. Ray florets
    [0] in 1(–2+) series, pistillate and fertile [neuter]; corollas usually yellow, sometimes
    reddish [ochroleucous or purplish] (laminae often linear). Disc florets bisexual, fertile;
    corollas usually yellow, sometimes reddish [ochroleucous or purplish], not 2-lipped, lobes
    (4–)5, usually ± deltate; anther bases ± tailed, apical appendages ovate to lance-ovate or
    linear; styles abaxially glabrous or papillate (distally), branches ± linear, adaxially
    stigmatic in 2 lines from bases to apices (lines often confluent distally), apices rounded to
    truncate, appendages essentially none. Cypselae usually monomorphic within heads, usually
    ellipsoid or columnar to prismatic [compressed or obcompressed], not beaked (sometimes abruptly
    constricted at each end), bodies often ribbed (glabrous or hairy, often glandular, hairs not
    myxogenic); pappi persistent (fragile), of ± barbellate [plumose] scales (sometimes setiform or
    aristate) and/or bristles.</description>

  <discussion>Following A. A. Anderberg (1994) and others, some 180 genera and 2000 species have
    been segregated from traditionally circumscribed Inuleae as Gnaphalieae, and another 25+ genera
    and 200+ species as Plucheeae.</discussion>
