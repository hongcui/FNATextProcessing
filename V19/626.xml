  <discussion>Antennaria geyeri is distinctive because it has woody upright branches and is not stoloniferous. It lacks basal leaves at flowering and has heads that are often described as subdioecious (central flowers are often bisexual). As the only member of the Geyerae group, A. geyeri is not closely related to any other species of Antennaria; it bears strong similarities to some species of Anaphalis (R. J. Bayer 1990; Bayer et al. 1996).</discussion>
