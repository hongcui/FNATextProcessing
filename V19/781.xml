  <discussion>Variety sparsiflora is known from the Coast Ranges and has outliers in western San Diego County and on the nearer Channel Islands. In the southern half of its range, it grows mostly in coastal marine environments, where it remains distinct from the north-coastal var. brevifolia. Consistently stemless plants from Santa Rosa Island may warrant taxonomic separation.</discussion>
