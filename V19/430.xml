  <description>Annuals [perennials], 10–40(–60+) cm; taprooted. Stems usually 1, erect, branched distally, setose to hispid or glabrous [pilosulous]. Leaves mostly cauline (at flowering) [mostly basal]; proximal ± petiolate, distal sessile; blades of the proximal mostly obovate to oblong-obovate, usually pinnately lobed or dentate, distal ovate to linear (bases often clasping), ultimate margins dentate or entire (veins often setose on abaxial faces). Heads borne singly or in loose, corymbiform arrays. Peduncles little, if at all, inflated distally, rarely bracteate. Calyculi 0. Involucres ± urceolate, 10–20+ mm diam. Phyllaries 7–8(–12+) in 1(–2) series, ovate-lanceolate to lance-linear (basally connate), subequal, margins scarious, apices acuminate. Receptacles flat to convex, pitted, hispid, epaleate. Florets 20–50+; corollas yellow, sometimes striped abaxially with red. Cypselae brown, bodies flattened-oblong, ± tuberculate, faces glabrous or scabrellous, beaks proximally dilated and tuberculate, distally acuminate and scabrous to scabrellous; pappi readily falling, of 18–22+ white [buff to rufous], subequal, plumose bristles in 1(–2) series (basally connate, falling together). x = 5, 7?.</description>
