Leaves basal and cauline (mostly cauline at flowering); proximal ± petiolate, distal ± sessile; blades oblanceolate to spatulate (bases often clasping), margins pinnately lobed (lyrate to runcinate, terminal lobes ± deltate) and ± sharply dentate (faces glabrous). Heads in paniculiform to thyrsiform arrays. Peduncles not inflated distally, sometimes bracteolate. Calyculi of 2–4 (often spreading to patent), ± deltate to lanceolate bractlets in 1 series. Involucres narrowly cylindric, 1–2+ mm diam. Phyllaries (4–)5 in 1(–2) series (reflexed in fruit), linear, equal, margins little, if at all, scarious, apices rounded. Receptacles flat to convex, weakly pitted, glabrous, epaleate. Florets 5; corollas yellow. Cypselae: bodies blackish to reddish, compressed, obovoid to lanceoloid, beaks whitish, stout, ribs 5–7 on each face, faces scabrellous; pappi persistent (borne on discs at tips of beaks), white; outer of 12–20+, minute setae, inner of 60–80+, white, subequal, barbellulate bristles in 1–2+ series. x = 9.</description>
