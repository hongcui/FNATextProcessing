  <discussion>Sonchus palustris was found in Ontario by D. F. Brunton and C. W. Crompton (1993) in the Ottawa area, and by J. K. Morton and J. M. Venn (1995) in the Waterloo region.</discussion>
  <discussion>The plants in the flora area are subsp. palustris. Subspecies sosnowskyi (Schchian) Boulos, from a single location in the southern Caucasus of eastern Europe, differs primarily in having glabrous stems, peduncles, and heads.</discussion>
