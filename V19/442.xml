Heads borne singly or in loose, corymbiform arrays. Peduncles ± inflated distally, not bracteate. Calyculi of 3–10+, deltate to lanceolate or lance-linear bractlets. Involucres campanulate to cylindric, 3–12 mm diam. (larger, ± globose in fruit). Phyllaries 5–13+ in 1 series, linear-navicular (± keeled, each ± enfolding subtended ovary or cypsela), subequal, margins little, if at all, scarious, apices acuminate. Receptacles flat, ± pitted, glabrous, epaleate. Florets 8–30+; corollas yellow (often reddish proximally, greenish abaxially). Cypselae dark brown to black, cylindric to fusiform (usually ± arcuate), not beaked, ribs 12–15, faces ± scabrous or barbed; pappi persistent, whitish; on outer cypselae often coroniform (distinct or connate, erose to fimbriate scales); on inner cypselae 0–5+, cuneate to lanceolate or subulate outer scales plus 5+, lance-aristate to subulate-aristate, inner scales. x = 9.</description>
