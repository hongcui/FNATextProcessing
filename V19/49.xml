  <discussion>Carduus pycnocephalus var. pycnocephalus has been reported from New York; I have not seen a specimen from there.</discussion>
  <discussion>Italian thistle is a serious rangeland pest in much of California, especially near the coast where it sometimes forms pure stands, both in full sun and in partial shade. Populations increase under grazing pressure as more palatable plants are preferentially consumed.</discussion>
  <discussion>Old herbarium records indicate that Carduus pycnocephalus was introduced on ballast into several east-coast ports (e.g., Philadelphia, Mobile) in the 1800s; the lack of subsequent collections suggests that conditions were unsuitable for the species to become permanently established.</discussion>
  <discussion>The only published chromosome counts for Carduus pycnocephalus from North American material are from California specimens (A. M. Powell et. al. 1974). Published chromosome counts (2n = 18, 31, 32, 54, 60, 64, 80) for C. pycnocephalus from a variety of Old World localities indicate that this is a complex species in need of further investigation.</discussion>
