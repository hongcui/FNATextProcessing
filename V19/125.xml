  <discussion>Variety arizonicum is widely distributed across the uplands of the American Southwest from eastern California across the Basin and Range Province to the Colorado Plateau and the mountains of Arizona and New Mexico. It is the most widely distributed and most variable variety of Cirsium arizonicum. Viciously spiny plants with deeply divided leaves from the northern part of the range of var. arizonicum often have been treated as C. nidulum. These plants form a continuum with the less spiny plants of more southerly distribution, however, and separation of two varieties (or species) is arbitrary.</discussion>
  <discussion>Leaves of some plants of var. arizonicum from Coconino County, Arizona, resemble those of the sympatric C. wheeleri. I have not seen hybrids between these taxa, but it is likely that some genetic interchange between the two has taken place in the past.</discussion>
