  <discussion>Subspecies arcticum is coastal from northern Japan and Russia to North America as far as northwestern British Columbia. It is cultivated as an ornamental. The chromosome number 2n = 72 has been reported from Russia for the species; it is uncertain to what subspecies this number may belong. No report apparently exists for this subspecies in North America.</discussion>
